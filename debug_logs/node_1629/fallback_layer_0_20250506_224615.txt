ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1629 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224615:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Regional Stability of an ERS/JERS-1 Classifer
Abstract: The potential of combined ERS/JERS-1 SAR images for land cover classification was demonstrated for the Raco test site (Michigan) in recent papers and articles. Our goal is to develop a classification algorithm which is stable in terms of applicability in different geographical regions. Unlike optical remote sensing techniques, radar remote sensing can provide calibrated data where the image signal is solely determined by the physical (structural) and electrical properties of the targets on the Earth's surface and near subsurface. Hence, a classifier based on radar signatures of object classes should be applicable on new calibrated images without the need to train the classifier again. This article discusses the design and applicability of a classification algorithm, which is based on calibrated radar signatures measured from ERS-1 (C-band, vv polarized) and JERS-1 (L-band, hh polarized) SAR image data. The applicability is compared in two different test sites, Raco, Michigan and the Cedar Creek LTER site, Minnesota. It was found, that classes separate very well, when certain boundary conditions like comparable seasonality or soil moisture conditions are observed."
