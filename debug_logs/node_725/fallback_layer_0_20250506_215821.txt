ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 725 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215821:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Maximum Working Likelihood Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
Abstract: Maximum working likelihood (MWL) inference in the presence of missing data can be quite challenging because of the intractability of the associated marginal likelihood. This problem can be further exacerbated when the number of parameters involved is large. We propose using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to first obtain both the MWL estimator and the working Fisher information matrix and, second, using Monte Carlo quadrature to obtain the remaining components of the correct asymptotic MWL variance. Evaluation of the marginal likelihood is not needed. We demonstrate consistency and asymptotic normality when the number of independent and identically distributed data clusters is large but the likelihood may be incorrectly specified. An analysis of longitudinal ordinal data is given for an example. KEY WORDS: Convergence of posterior distributions, Maximum likelihood, Metropolis"
