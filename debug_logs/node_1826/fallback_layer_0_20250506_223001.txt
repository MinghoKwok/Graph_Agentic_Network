ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1826 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223001:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Computational View of Population Genetics (preliminary version)
Abstract: This paper contributes to the study of nonlinear dynamical systems from a computational perspective. These systems are inherently more powerful than their linear counterparts (such as Markov chains), which have had a wide impact in Computer Science, and they seem likely to play an increasing role in future. However, there are as yet no general techniques available for handling the computational aspects of discrete nonlinear systems, and even the simplest examples seem very hard to analyze. We focus in this paper on a class of quadratic systems that are widely used as a model in population genetics and also in genetic algorithms. These systems describe a process where random matings occur between parental chromosomes via a mechanism known as "crossover": i.e., children inherit pieces of genetic material from different parents according to some random rule. Our results concern two fundamental quantitative properties of crossover systems: 1. We develop a general technique for computing the"
