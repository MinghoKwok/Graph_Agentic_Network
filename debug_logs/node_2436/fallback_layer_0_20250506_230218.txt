ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2436 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230218:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Space-Time Scheduling of Instruction-Level Parallelism on a Raw Machine
Abstract: Advances in VLSI technology will enable chips with over a billion transistors within the next decade. Unfortunately, the centralized-resource architectures of modern microprocessors are ill-suited to exploit such advances. Achieving a high level of parallelism at a reasonable clock speed requires distributing the processor resources a trend already visible in the dual-register-file architecture of the Alpha 21264. A Raw microprocessor takes an extreme position in this space by distributing all its resources such as instruction streams, register files, memory ports, and ALUs over a pipelined two-dimensional interconnect, and exposing them fully to the compiler. Compilation for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) on such distributed-resource machines requires both spatial instruction scheduling and traditional temporal instruction scheduling. This paper describes the techniques used by the Raw compiler to handle these issues. Preliminary results from a SUIF-based compiler for sequential programs written in C and Fortran indicate that the Raw approach to exploiting ILP can achieve speedups scalable with the number of processors for applications with such parallelism. The Raw architecture attempts to provide performance that is at least comparable to that provided by scaling an existing architecture, but that can achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance for applications with a large amount of parallelism. This paper offers some positive results in this direction."
