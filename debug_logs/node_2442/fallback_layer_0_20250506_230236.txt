ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2442 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230236:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
2. [Label_4] "Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of TD() for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) methods constit..."
3. [Label_4] "Multi-Time Models for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Reinforcement learning can be used not only to predict rewards, but also to predict states, i.e..."
4. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
5. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."

Text to classify:
"Using Temporal-Difference Reinforcement Learning to Improve Decision-Theoretic Utilities for Diagnosis
Abstract: Probability theory represents and manipulates uncertainties, but cannot tell us how to behave. For that we need utility theory which assigns values to the usefulness of different states, and decision theory which concerns optimal rational decisions. There are many methods for probability modeling, but few for learning utility and decision models. We use reinforcement learning to find the optimal sequence of questions in a diagnosis situation while maintaining a high accuracy. Automated diagnosis on a heart-disease domain is used to demonstrate that temporal-difference learning can improve diagnosis. On the Cleveland heart-disease database our results are better than those reported from all previous methods."
