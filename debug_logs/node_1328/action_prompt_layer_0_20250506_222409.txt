ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Action Prompt for Node 1328 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222409:

    You are Node 1328 in a scientific citation network. Your task is to classify yourself into the correct research category based on your text and connections.
    
    ## Few-shot Examples of Label Prediction:

    Example 1:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "A novel deep learning approach for image classification..."

    3. [Neural_Networks] "Convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Deep learning models for visual recognition tasks..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: The current text focuses on deep learning and visual recognition, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    Example 2:
    Memory:
    1. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Bayesian networks for uncertainty modeling..."
    2. [Neural_Networks] "Recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction..."
    3. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Markov models for time series analysis..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Hidden Markov models for speech recognition..."

    Prediction: Probabilistic_Methods
    Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models, which is a probabilistic method, matching the Probabilistic_Methods examples in memory.

    Example 3:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "Deep learning architectures for natural language processing..."
    2. [Theory] "Theoretical analysis of algorithm complexity..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Attention mechanisms in deep learning models for text understanding..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    "A Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Learning with Symbolic Features
Abstract: In the past, nearest neighbor algorithms for learning from examples have worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. In such domains, the examples can be treated as points and distance metrics can use standard definitions. In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances, and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity. We conclude that experimental evidence favors the use and continued development of nearest neighbor algorithms for domains such as the ones studied here."

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
