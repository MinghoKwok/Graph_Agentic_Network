ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 780 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213437:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
2. [Label_1] "nan Abstract: Co-evolution of Pursuit and Evasion II: Simulation Methods and Results fl Abstract In a previous SAB paper [10], we presented the scient..."
3. [Label_1] "Environmental Effects on Minimal Behaviors in the Minimat World Abstract: The structure of an environment affects the behaviors of the organisms that ..."
4. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
5. [Label_1] "A STUDY OF CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING Abstract: Holland's analysis of the sources of power of genetic algorithms has served as guidanc..."

Text to classify:
"Between-host evolution of mutation-rate and within-host evolution of virulence.
Abstract: It has been recently realized that parasite virulence (the harm caused by parasites to their hosts) can be an adaptive trait. Selection for a particular level of virulence can happen either at at the level of between-host tradeoffs or as a result of short-sighted within-host competition. This paper describes some simulations which study the effect that modifier genes for changes in mutation rate have on suppressing this short-sighted development of virulence, and investigates the interaction between this and a simplified model of im mune clearance."
