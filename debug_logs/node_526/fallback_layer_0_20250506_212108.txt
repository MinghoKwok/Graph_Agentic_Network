ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 526 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212108:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Category: Control, Navigation and Planning. Key words: Reinforcement learning, Exploration, Hidden state. Prefer oral presentation. Abstract: This pap..."
2. [Label_4] "Planning by Incremental Dynamic Programming Abstract: This paper presents the basic results and ideas of dynamic programming as they relate most direc..."
3. [Label_0] "Observation and Generalisation in a Simulated Robot World Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulat..."
4. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
5. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
