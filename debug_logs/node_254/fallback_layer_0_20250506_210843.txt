ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 254 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210843:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "Learning Trees and Rules with Set-valued Features Abstract: In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length "feature vectors", the c..."
2. [Label_5] "Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms Abstract: We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logi..."
3. [Label_2] "Word Perfect Corp. LIA: A Location-Independent Transformation for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2 Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a f..."
4. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
5. [Label_6] "Feature Generation for Sequence Categorization Abstract: The problem of sequence categorization is to generalize from a corpus of labeled sequences pr..."

Text to classify:
"Scaling-up RAAMs
Abstract: Modifications to Recursive Auto-Associative Memory are presented, which allow it to store deeper and more complex data structures than previously reported. These modifications include adding extra layers to the compressor and reconstructor networks, employing integer rather than real-valued representations, pre-conditioning the weights and pre-setting the representations to be compatible with them. The resulting system is tested on a data set of syntactic trees extracted from the Penn Treebank."
