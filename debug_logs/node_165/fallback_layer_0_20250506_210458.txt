ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 165 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210458:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "Abstract Abstract: This paper is a scientific comparison of two code generation techniques with identical goals generation of the best possible softwa..."
2. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."
3. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
4. [Label_5] "Modeling Superscalar Processors via Statistical Simulation Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_3] "Logarithmic Time Parallel Bayesian Inference Abstract: I present a parallel algorithm for exact probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. For poly..."

Text to classify:
"d d The Effects of Predicated Execution on Branch Prediction
Abstract: This paper analyzes a variety of existing predication models for eliminating branch operations, and the effect that this elimination has on the branch prediction schemes in existing processors, including single issue architectures with simple prediction mechanisms, to the newer multi-issue designs with correspondingly more sophisticated branch predictors. The effect on branch prediction accuracy, branch penalty and basic block size is studied."
