ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 741 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213233:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Incremental Grid Growing: Encoding High-Dimensional Structure into a Two-Dimensional Feature Map
Abstract: Knowledge of clusters and their relations is important in understanding high-dimensional input data with unknown distribution. Ordinary feature maps with fully connected, fixed grid topology cannot properly reflect the structure of clusters in the input space|there are no cluster boundaries on the map. Incremental feature map algorithms, where nodes and connections are added to or deleted from the map according to the input distribution, can overcome this problem. However, so far such algorithms have been limited to maps that can be drawn in 2-D only in the case of 2-dimensional input space. In the approach proposed in this paper, nodes are added incrementally to a regular, 2-dimensional grid, which is drawable at all times, irrespective of the dimensionality of the input space. The process results in a map that explicitly represents the cluster structure of the high-dimensional input."
