ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 784 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220128:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Studies of Neurological Transmission Analysis using Hierarchical Bayesian Mixture Models
Abstract: Hierarchically structured mixture models are studied in the context of data analysis and inference on neural synaptic transmission characteristics in mammalian, and other, central nervous systems. Mixture structures arise due to uncertainties about the stochastic mechanisms governing the responses to electro-chemical stimulation of individual neuro-transmitter release sites at nerve junctions. Models attempt to capture scientific features such as the sensitivity of individual synaptic transmission sites to electro-chemical stimuli, and the extent of their electro-chemical responses when stimulated. This is done via suitably structured classes of prior distributions for parameters describing these features. Such priors may be structured to permit assessment of currently topical scientific hypotheses about fundamental neural function. Posterior analysis is implemented via stochastic simulation. Several data analyses are described to illustrate the approach, with resulting neurophysiological insights in some recently generated experimental contexts. Further developments and open questions, both neurophysiological and statistical, are noted. Research partially supported by the NSF under grants DMS-9024793, DMS-9305699 and DMS-9304250. This work represents part of a collaborative project with Dr Dennis A Turner, of Duke University Medical Center and Durham VA. Data was provided by Dr Turner and by Dr Howard V Wheal of Southampton University. A slightly revised version of this paper is published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association (vol 92, pp587-606), under the modified title Hierarchical Mixture Models in Neurological Transmission Analysis. The author is the recipient of the 1997 Mitchell Prize for "the Bayesian analysis of a substantive and concrete problem" based on the work reported in this paper."
