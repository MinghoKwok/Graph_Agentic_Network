ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 658 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212809:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Hill Climbing with Learning (An Abstraction of Genetic Algorithm)
Abstract: Simple modification of standard hill climbing optimization algorithm by taking into account learning features is discussed. Basic concept of this approach is the socalled probability vector, its single entries determine probabilities of appearance of '1' entries in n-bit vectors. This vector is used for the random generation of n-bit vectors that form a neighborhood (specified by the given probability vector). Within the neighborhood a few best solutions (with smallest functional values of a minimized function) are recorded. The feature of learning is introduced here so that the probability vector is updated by a formal analogue of Hebbian learning rule, well-known in the theory of artificial neural networks. The process is repeated until the probability vector entries are close either to zero or to one. The resulting probability vector unambiguously determines an n-bit vector which may be interpreted as an optimal solution of the given optimization task. Resemblance with genetic algorithms is discussed. Effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example of looking for global minima of a highly multimodal function."
