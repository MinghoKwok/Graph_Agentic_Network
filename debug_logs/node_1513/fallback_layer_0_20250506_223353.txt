ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1513 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223353:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Fast NP Chunking Using Memory-Based Learning Techniques
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the application of Memory-Based Learning (MBL) to fast NP chunking. We first discuss the application of a fast decision tree variant of MBL (IGTree) on the dataset described in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), which consists of roughly 50,000 test and 200,000 train items. In a second series of experiments we used an architecture of two cascaded IGTrees. In the second level of this cascaded classifier we added context predictions as extra features so that incorrect predictions from the first level can be corrected, yielding a 97.2% generalisation accuracy with training and testing times in the order of seconds to minutes."
