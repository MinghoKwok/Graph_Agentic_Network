ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 341 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213802:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Some Comments on the Information Stored in Sparse Distributed Memory
Abstract: Report R95:11 ISRN : SICS-R--95/11-SE ISSN : 0283-3638 Abstract We consider a sparse distributed memory with randomly chosen hard locations, in which an unknown number T of random data vectors have been stored. A method is given to estimate T from the content of the memory with high accuracy. In fact, our estimate is unbiased, the coefficient of variation being roughly inversely proportional to p MU , where M is the number of hard locations in the memory and U the length of data, so the accuracy can be made arbitrarily high by making the memory big enough. A consequence of this is that the good reading methods in [5] and [6] can be used without any need for the special extra location introduced there."
