ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1524 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223428:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"BLIND SEPARATION OF DELAYED SOURCES BASED ON INFORMATION MAXIMIZATION
Abstract: Recently, Bell and Sejnowski have presented an approach to blind source separation based on the information maximization principle. We extend this approach into more general cases where the sources may have been delayed with respect to each other. We present a network architecture capable of coping with such sources, and we derive the adaptation equations for the delays and the weights in the network by maximizing the information transferred through the network. Examples using wideband sources such as speech are presented to illustrate the algorithm."
