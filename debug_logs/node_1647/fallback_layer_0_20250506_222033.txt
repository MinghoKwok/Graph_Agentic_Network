ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1647 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222033:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
2. [Label_0] "AN INCREMENTAL LEARNING MODEL FOR COMMONSENSE REASONING Abstract:"
3. [Label_0] "In Machine Learning: A Multistrategy Approach, Vol. IV  Macro and Micro Perspectives of Multistrategy Learning Abstract: Machine learning techniques a..."
4. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."
5. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."

"Recognition and Exploitation of Contextual Clues via Incremental Meta-Learning (Extended Version)
Abstract: Daily experience shows that in the real world, the meaning of many concepts heavily depends on some implicit context, and changes in that context can cause more or less radical changes in the concepts. Incremental concept learning in such domains requires the ability to recognize and adapt to such changes. This paper presents a solution for incremental learning tasks where the domain provides explicit clues as to the current context (e.g., attributes with characteristic values). We present a general two-level learning model, and its realization in a system named MetaL(B), that can learn to detect certain types of contextual clues, and can react accordingly when a context change is suspected. The model consists of a base level learner that performs the regular on-line learning and classification task, and a meta-learner that identifies potential contextual clues. Context learning and detection occur during regular on-line learning, without separate training phases for context recognition. Experiments with synthetic domains as well as a `real-world' problem show that MetaL(B) is robust in a variety of dimensions and produces substantial improvement over simple object-level learning in situations with changing contexts."
