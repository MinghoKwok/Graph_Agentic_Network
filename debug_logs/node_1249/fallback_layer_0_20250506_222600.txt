ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1249 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222600:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolution of Non-Deterministic Incremental Algorithms as a New Approach for Search in State Spaces
Abstract: Let us call a non-deterministic incremental algorithm one that is able to construct any solution to a combinatorial problem by selecting incrementally an ordered sequence of choices that defines this solution, each choice being made non-deterministically. In that case, the state space can be represented as a tree, and a solution is a path from the root of that tree to a leaf. This paper describes how the simulated evolution of a population of such non-deterministic incremental algorithms offers a new approach for the exploration of a state space, compared to other techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Strategies (ES) or Hill Climbing. In particular, the efficiency of this method, implemented as the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model, is presented for the sorting network problem, a reference problem that has challenged computer science. Then, we shall show that the END model remedies some drawbacks of these optimization techniques and even outperforms them for this problem. Indeed, some 16-input sorting networks as good as the best known have been built from scratch, and even a 25-year-old result for the 13-input problem has been improved by one comparator."
