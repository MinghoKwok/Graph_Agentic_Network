    "1 FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM time needed for learning a sufficiently accurate
Abstract: Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. This is due to the fact that the performance of the classifier (usually induced by some learning algorithm) and the cost of classification are sensitive to the choice of the features used to construct the classifier. Exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets is usually infeasible in practice because of the large amount of computational effort required. Genetic algorithms, which belong to a class of randomized heuristic search techniques, offer an attractive approach to find near-optimal solutions to such optimization problems. This paper presents an approach to feature subset selection using a genetic algorithm. Some advantages of this approach include the ability to accommodate multiple criteria such as accuracy and cost of classification into the feature selection process and to find feature subsets that perform well for particular choices of the inductive learning algorithm used to construct the pattern classifier. Our experiments with several benchmark real-world pattern classification problems demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to feature subset selection in the automated Many practical pattern classification tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis) require learning of an appropriate classification function that assigns a given input pattern (typically represented using a vector of attribute or feature values) to one of a finite set of classes. The choice of features, attributes, or measurements used to represent patterns that are presented to a classifier affect (among other things): The accuracy of the classification function that can be learned using an inductive learning algorithm (e.g., a decision tree induction algorithm or a neural network learning algorithm): The features used to describe the patterns implicitly define a pattern language. If the language is not expressive enough, it would fail to capture the information that is necessary for classification and hence regardless of the learning algorithm used, the accuracy of the classification function learned would be limited by this lack of information. design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery."

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
