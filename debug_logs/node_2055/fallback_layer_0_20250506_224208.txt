ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2055 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224208:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"1 FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM time needed for learning a sufficiently accurate
Abstract: Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. This is due to the fact that the performance of the classifier (usually induced by some learning algorithm) and the cost of classification are sensitive to the choice of the features used to construct the classifier. Exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets is usually infeasible in practice because of the large amount of computational effort required. Genetic algorithms, which belong to a class of randomized heuristic search techniques, offer an attractive approach to find near-optimal solutions to such optimization problems. This paper presents an approach to feature subset selection using a genetic algorithm. Some advantages of this approach include the ability to accommodate multiple criteria such as accuracy and cost of classification into the feature selection process and to find feature subsets that perform well for particular choices of the inductive learning algorithm used to construct the pattern classifier. Our experiments with several benchmark real-world pattern classification problems demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to feature subset selection in the automated Many practical pattern classification tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis) require learning of an appropriate classification function that assigns a given input pattern (typically represented using a vector of attribute or feature values) to one of a finite set of classes. The choice of features, attributes, or measurements used to represent patterns that are presented to a classifier affect (among other things): The accuracy of the classification function that can be learned using an inductive learning algorithm (e.g., a decision tree induction algorithm or a neural network learning algorithm): The features used to describe the patterns implicitly define a pattern language. If the language is not expressive enough, it would fail to capture the information that is necessary for classification and hence regardless of the learning algorithm used, the accuracy of the classification function learned would be limited by this lack of information. design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery."
