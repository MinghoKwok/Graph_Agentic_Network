ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2533 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233249:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"An Object-Based Neural Model of Serial Processing in Visual Multielement Tracking
Abstract: A quantitative model is provided for psychophysical data on the tracking of multiple visual elements (multielement tracking). The model employs an object-based attentional mechanism for constructing and updating object representations. The model selectively enhances neural activations to serially construct and update the internal representations of objects through correlation-based changes in synaptic weights. The correspondence problem between items in memory and elements in the visual input is resolved through a combination of top-down prediction signals and bottom-up grouping processes. Simulations of the model on image sequences used in multielement tracking experiments show that reported results are consistent with a serial tracking mechanism that is based on psychophysical and neurobiological findings. In addition, simulations show that observed effects of perceptual grouping on tracking accuracy may result from the interactions between attention-guided predictions of object location and motion and grouping processes involved in solving the motion correspondence problem."
