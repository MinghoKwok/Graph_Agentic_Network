ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1811 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225555:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_0: 2 examples

- Label_6: 2 examples

"Disambiguation and Grammar as Emergent Soft Constraints
Abstract: When reading a sentence such as "The diplomat threw the ball in the ballpark for the princess" our interpretation changes from a dance event to baseball and back to dance. Such on-line disambiguation happens automatically and appears to be based on dynamically combining the strengths of association between the keywords and the two senses. Subsymbolic neural networks are very good at modeling such behavior. They learn word meanings as soft constraints on interpretation, and dynamically combine these constraints to form the most likely interpretation. On the other hand, it is very difficult to show how systematic language structures such as relative clauses could be processed in such a system. The network would only learn to associate them to specific contexts and would not be able to process new combinations of them. A closer look at understanding embedded clauses shows that humans are not very systematic in processing grammatical structures either. For example, "The girl who the boy who the girl who lived next door blamed hit cried" is very difficult to understand, whereas "The car that the man who the dog that had rabies bit drives is in the garage" is not. This difference emerges from the same semantic constraints that are at work in the disambiguation task. In this chapter we will show how the subsymbolic parser can be combined with high-level control that allows the system to process novel combinations of relative clauses systematically, while still being sensitive to the semantic constraints."
