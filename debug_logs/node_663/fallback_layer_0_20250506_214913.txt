ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 663 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214913:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Perceptual Development and Learning: From Behavioral, Neurophysiological, and Morphological Evidence To Computational Models
Abstract: An intelligent system has to be capable of adapting to a constantly changing environment. It therefore, ought to be capable of learning from its perceptual interactions with its surroundings. This requires a certain amount of plasticity in its structure. Any attempt to model the perceptual capabilities of a living system or, for that matter, to construct a synthetic system of comparable abilities, must therefore, account for such plasticity through a variety of developmental and learning mechanisms. This paper examines some results from neuroanatomical, morphological, as well as behavioral studies of the development of visual perception; integrates them into a computational framework; and suggests several interesting experiments with computational models that can yield insights into the development of visual perception. In order to understand the development of information processing structures in the brain, one needs knowledge of changes it undergoes from birth to maturity in the context of a normal environment. However, knowledge of its development in aberrant settings is also extremely useful, because it reveals the extent to which the development is a function of environmental experience (as opposed to genetically determined pre-wiring). Accordingly, we consider development of the visual system under both normal and restricted rearing conditions. The role of experience in the early development of the sensory systems in general, and the visual system in particular, has been widely studied through a variety of experiments involving carefully controlled manipulation of the environment presented to an animal. Extensive reviews of such results can be found in (Mitchell, 1984; Movshon, 1981; Hirsch, 1986; Boothe, 1986; Singer, 1986). Some examples of manipulation of visual experience are total pattern deprivation (e.g., dark rearing), selective deprivation of a certain class of patterns (e.g., vertical lines), monocular deprivation in animals with binocular vision, etc. Extensive studies involving behavioral deficits resulting from total visual pattern deprivation indicate that the deficits arise primarily as a result of impairment of visual information processing in the brain. The results of these experiments suggest specific developmental or learning mechanisms that may be operating at various stages of development, and at different levels in the system. We will discuss some of these hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This is a working draft. All comments, especially constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, will be appreciated. I am indebted to Prof. James Dannemiller for introducing me to some of the literature in infant development; to Prof. Leonard Uhr for his helpful comments on an initial draft of the paper; and to numerous researchers whose experimental work has provided the basis for the model outlined in this paper. This research was partially supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Graduate School."
