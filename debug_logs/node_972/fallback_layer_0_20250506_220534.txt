ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 972 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220534:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On Genetic Programming of Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for Intelligent Control
Abstract: Fuzzy logic and evolutionary computation have proven to be convenient tools for handling real-world uncertainty and designing control systems, respectively. An approach is presented that combines attributes of these paradigms for the purpose of developing intelligent control systems. The potential of the genetic programming paradigm (GP) for learning rules for use in fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) is evaluated by focussing on the problem of discovering a controller for mobile robot path tracking. Performance results of incomplete rule-bases compare favorably to those of a complete FLC designed by the usual trial-and-error approach. A constrained syntactic representation supported by structure-preserving genetic operators is also introduced."
