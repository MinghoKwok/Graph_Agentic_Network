ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 863 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213901:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_3] "Maximum Likelihood and Covariant Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis somewhat more biologically plausible, involving no Abstract: Bell and S..."
2. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
3. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_3] "Discovering Structure in Continuous Variables Using Bayesian Networks Abstract: We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using nonlinear co..."
5. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."

Text to classify:
"Empirical Entropy Manipulation for Real-World Problems
Abstract: No finite sample is sufficient to determine the density, and therefore the entropy, of a signal directly. Some assumption about either the functional form of the density or about its smoothness is necessary. Both amount to a prior over the space of possible density functions. By far the most common approach is to assume that the density has a parametric form. By contrast we derive a differential learning rule called EMMA that optimizes entropy by way of kernel density estimation. Entropy and its derivative can then be calculated by sampling from this density estimate. The resulting parameter update rule is surprisingly simple and efficient. We will show how EMMA can be used to detect and correct corruption in magnetic resonance images (MRI). This application is beyond the scope of existing parametric entropy models."
