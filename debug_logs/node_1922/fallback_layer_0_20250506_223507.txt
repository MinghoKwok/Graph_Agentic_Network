ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1922 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223507:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_3] "On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary Abstract: New methodology for fully Bayesian mixture analysis is develo..."
4. [Label_3] "SINGLE FACTOR ANALYSIS BY MML ESTIMATION Abstract: The Minimum Message Length (MML) technique is applied to the problem of estimating the parameters o..."
5. [Label_2] "Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units Abstract: We propose two algorithms for constructing and traini..."

Text to classify:
"Maximum Likelihood and Covariant Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis somewhat more biologically plausible, involving no
Abstract: Bell and Sejnowski (1995) have derived a blind signal processing algorithm for a non-linear feedforward network from an information maximization viewpoint. This paper first shows that the same algorithm can be viewed as a maximum likelihood algorithm for the optimization of a linear generative model. Third, this paper gives a partial proof of the `folk-theorem' that any mixture of sources with high-kurtosis histograms is separable by the classic ICA algorithm."
