ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1096 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215119:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_2] "Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units Abstract: We propose two algorithms for constructing and traini..."
4. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"Pruning backpropagation neural networks using modern stochastic optimization techniques
Abstract: Approaches combining genetic algorithms and neural networks have received a great deal of attention in recent years. As a result, much work has been reported in two major areas of neural network design: training and topology optimization. This paper focuses on the key issues associated with the problem of pruning a multilayer perceptron using genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. The study presented considers a number of aspects associated with network training that may alter the behavior of a stochastic topology optimizer. Enhancements are discussed that can improve topology searches. Simulation results for the two mentioned stochastic optimization methods applied to nonlinear system identification are presented and compared with a simple random search."
