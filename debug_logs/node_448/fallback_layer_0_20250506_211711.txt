You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
2. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
3. [Label_1] "ADAPTIVE TESTING OF CONTROLLERS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to main..."
4. [Label_0] "Observation and Generalisation in a Simulated Robot World Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulat..."
5. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."

"Grounding Robotic Control with Genetic Neural Networks
Abstract: Technical Report AI94-223 May 1994 Abstract An important but often neglected problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence is that of grounding systems in their environment such that the representations they manipulate have inherent meaning for the system. Since humans rely so heavily on semantics, it seems likely that the grounding is crucial to the development of truly intelligent behavior. This study investigates the use of simulated robotic agents with neural network processors as part of a method to ensure grounding. Both the topology and weights of the neural networks are optimized through genetic algorithms. Although such comprehensive optimization is difficult, the empirical evidence gathered here shows that the method is not only tractable but quite fruitful. In the experiments, the agents evolved a wall-following control strategy and were able to transfer it to novel environments. Their behavior suggests that they were also learning to build cognitive maps."
