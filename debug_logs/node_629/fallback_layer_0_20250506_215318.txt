ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 629 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215318:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."
3. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."

Text to classify:
"Using Introspective Reasoning to Select Learning Strategies
Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a system must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires a declaratflive representation of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task. This paper presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during this task, their declarative representations, and their associations with particular learning strategies. We propose a theory of Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. A program called Meta-AQUA embodies the theory and processes examples in the domain of drug smuggling."
