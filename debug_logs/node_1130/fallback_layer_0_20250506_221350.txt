ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1130 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221350:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Dynamic Hill Climbing: Overcoming the limita- tions of optimization techniques
Abstract: This paper describes a novel search algorithm, called dynamic hill climbing, that borrows ideas from genetic algorithms and hill climbing techniques. Unlike both genetic and hill climbing algorithms, dynamic hill climbing has the ability to dynamically change its coordinate frame during the course of an optimization. Furthermore, the algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate and uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space. Dynamic hill climbing is empirically compared to a traditional genetic algorithm using De Jong's well-known five function test suite [4] and is shown to vastly surpass the performance of the genetic algorithm, often finding better solutions using only 1% as many function evaluations."
