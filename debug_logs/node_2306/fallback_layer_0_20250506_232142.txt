ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2306 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232142:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On the Applicability of Neural Network and Machine Learning Methodologies to Natural Language Processing
Abstract: We examine the inductive inference of a complex grammar specifically, we consider the task of training a model to classify natural language sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical, thereby exhibiting the same kind of discriminatory power provided by the Principles and Parameters linguistic framework, or Government-and-Binding theory. We investigate the following models: feed-forward neural networks, Fransconi-Gori-Soda and Back-Tsoi locally recurrent networks, Elman, Narendra & Parthasarathy, and Williams & Zipser recurrent networks, Euclidean and edit-distance nearest-neighbors, simulated annealing, and decision trees. The feed-forward neural networks and non-neural network machine learning models are included primarily for comparison. We address the question: How can a neural network, with its distributed nature and gradient descent based iterative calculations, possess linguistic capability which is traditionally handled with symbolic computation and recursive processes? Initial simulations with all models were only partially successful by using a large temporal window as input. Models trained in this fashion did not learn the grammar to a significant degree. Attempts at training recurrent networks with small temporal input windows failed until we implemented several techniques aimed at improving the convergence of the gradient descent training algorithms. We discuss the theory and present an empirical study of a variety of models and learning algorithms which highlights behaviour not present when attempting to learn a simpler grammar."
