ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1772 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224733:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"New Inexact Parallel Variable Distribution Algorithms  Editor:
Abstract: We consider the recently proposed parallel variable distribution (PVD) algorithm of Ferris and Mangasarian [4] for solving optimization problems in which the variables are distributed among p processors. Each processor has the primary responsibility for updating its block of variables while allowing the remaining "secondary" variables to change in a restricted fashion along some easily computable directions. We propose useful generalizations that consist, for the general unconstrained case, of replacing exact global solution of the subproblems by a certain natural sufficient descent condition, and, for the convex case, of inexact subproblem solution in the PVD algorithm. These modifications are the key features of the algorithm that has not been analyzed before. The proposed modified algorithms are more practical and make it easier to achieve good load balancing among the parallel processors. We present a general framework for the analysis of this class of algorithms and derive some new and improved linear convergence results for problems with weak sharp minima of order 2 and strongly convex problems. We also show that nonmonotone synchronization schemes are admissible, which further improves flexibility of PVD approach."
