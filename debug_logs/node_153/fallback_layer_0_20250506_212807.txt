ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 153 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212807:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Living in a partially structured environment: How to bypass the limitations of classical reinforcement techniques
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an unsupervised neural network allowing a robot to learn sensori-motor associations with a delayed reward. The robot task is to learn the "meaning" of pictograms in order to "survive" in a maze. First, we introduce a new neural conditioning rule (PCR: Probabilistic Conditioning Rule) allowing to test hypotheses (associations between visual categories and movements) during a given time span. Second, we describe a real maze experiment with our mobile robot. We propose a neural architecture to solve this problem and we discuss the difficulty to build visual categories dynamically while associating them to movements. Third, we propose to use our algorithm on a simulation in order to test it exhaustively. We give the results for different kind of mazes and we compare our system to an adapted version of the Q-learning algorithm. Finally, we conclude by showing the limitations of approaches that do not take into account the intrinsic complexity of a reasonning based on image recognition."
