ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1972 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223745:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"ON MCMC METHODS IN BAYESIAN REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND MODEL SELECTION
Abstract: The objective of statistical data analysis is not only to describe the behaviour of a system, but also to propose, construct (and then to check) a model of observed processes. Bayesian methodology offers one of possible approaches to estimation of unknown components of the model (its parameters or functional components) in a framework of a chosen model type. However, in many instances the evaluation of Bayes posterior distribution (which is basal for Bayesian solutions) is difficult and practically intractable (even with the help of numerical approximations). In such cases the Bayesian analysis may be performed with the help of intensive simulation techniques called the `Markov chain Monte Carlo'. The present paper reviews the best known approaches to MCMC generation. It deals with several typical situations of data analysis and model construction where MCMC methods have been successfully applied. Special attention is devoted to the problem of selection of optimal regression model constructed from regression splines or from other functional units."
