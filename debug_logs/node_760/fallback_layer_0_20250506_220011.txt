ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 760 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220011:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost."
