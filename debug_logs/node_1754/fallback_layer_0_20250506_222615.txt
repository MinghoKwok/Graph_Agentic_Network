ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1754 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222615:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The Neural Network House: An Overview
Abstract: Typical home comfort systems utilize only rudimentary forms of energy management and conservation. The most sophisticated technology in common use today is an automatic setback thermostat. Tremendous potential remains for improving the efficiency of electric and gas usage. However, home residents who are ignorant of the physics of energy utilization cannot design environmental control strategies, but neither can energy management experts who are ignorant of the behavior patterns of the inhabitants. Adaptive control seems the only alternative. We have begun building an adaptive control system that can infer appropriate rules of operation for home comfort systems based on the lifestyle of the inhabitants and energy conservation goals. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of neural networks for intelligent control. We are constructing a prototype control system in an actual residence using neural network reinforcement learning and prediction techniques. The residence is equipped with sensors to provide information about environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures, ambient lighting level, sound and motion in each room) and actuators to control the gas furnace, electric space heaters, gas hot water heater, lighting, motorized blinds, ceiling fans, and dampers in the heating ducts. This paper presents an overview of the project as it now stands."
