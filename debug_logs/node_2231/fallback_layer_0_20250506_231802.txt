ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2231 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231802:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Explaining Anomalies as a Basis for Knowledge Base Refinement
Abstract: Explanations play a key role in operationalization-based anomaly detection techniques. In this paper we show that their role is not limited to anomaly detection; they can also be used for guiding automated knowledge base refinement. We introduce a refinement procedure which takes: (i) a small number of refinement rules (rather than test cases), and (ii) explanations constructed in an attempt to reveal the cause (or causes) for inconsistencies detected during the verification process, and returns rule revisions aiming to recover the consistency of the KB-theory. Inconsistencies caused by more than one anomaly are handled at the same time, which improves the efficiency of the refinement process."
