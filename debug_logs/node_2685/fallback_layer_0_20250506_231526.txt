ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2685 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231526:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

3. [Label_3] "Discovering Structure in Continuous Variables Using Bayesian Networks Abstract: We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using nonlinear co..."
4. [Label_4] "Towards a Reactive Critic Abstract: In this paper we propose a reactive critic, that is able to respond to changing situations. We will explain why th..."
5. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."

Text to classify:
"Learning under persistent drift
Abstract: In this paper we study learning algorithms for environments which are changing over time. Unlike most previous work, we are interested in the case where the changes might be rapid but their "direction" is relatively constant. We model this type of change by assuming that the target distribution is changing continuously at a constant rate from one extreme distribution to another. We show in this case how to use a simple weighting scheme to estimate the error of an hypothesis, and using this estimate, to minimize the error of the prediction."
