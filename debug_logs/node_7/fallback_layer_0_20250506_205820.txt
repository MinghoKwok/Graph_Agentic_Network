ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 7 | Layer 0 | 20250506_205820:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Optimal Alignments in Linear Space using Automaton-derived Cost Functions (Extended Abstract) Submitted to CPM'96 Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95]..."
2. [Label_0] "Observation and Generalisation in a Simulated Robot World Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulat..."
3. [Label_2] "Homology Detection via Family Pairwise Search a straightforward generalization of pairwise sequence comparison algorithms to Abstract: The function of..."
4. [Label_5] "Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on Abstract: This paper tackles the supe..."
5. [Label_0] "A systematic description of greedy optimisation algorithms for cost sensitive generalisation Abstract: This paper defines a class of problems involvin..."

Text to classify:
"Optimal Alignments in Linear Space using Automaton-derived Cost Functions (Extended Abstract) Submitted to CPM'96
Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95], we showed how finite automata could be used to define objective functions for assessing the quality of an alignment of two (or more) sequences. In this paper, we show some results of using such cost functions. We also show how to extend Hischberg's linear space algorithm [Hir75] to this setting, thus generalizing a result of Myers and Miller [MM88b]."
