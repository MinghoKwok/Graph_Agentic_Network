ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1861 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225834:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Six-Point Condition for Ordinal Matrices  keywords: additive, algorithm, evolution, ordinal, phylogeny
Abstract: Ordinal assertions in an evolutionary context are of the form "species s is more similar to species x than to species y" and can be deduced from a distance matrix M of interspecies dissimilarities (M [s; x] &lt; M [s; y]). Given species x and y, the ordinal binary character c xy of M is defined by c xy (s) = 1 if and only if M [s; x] &lt; M[s; y], for all species s. In this paper we present several results concerning the inference of evolutionary trees or phylogenies from ordinal assertions. In particular, we present A six-point condition that characterizes those distance matrices whose ordinal binary characters are pairwise compatible. This characterization is analogous to the four-point condition for additive matrices. An optimal O(n 2 ) algorithm, where n is the number of species, for recovering a phylogeny that realizes the ordinal binary characters of a distance matrix that satisfies the six-point condition. An NP-completeness result on determining if there is a phylogeny that realizes k or more of the ordinal binary characters of a given distance matrix."
