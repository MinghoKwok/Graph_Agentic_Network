You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Abstract: So applying Corollary 4.3 to the second equation in (47), we conclude that From (38), we then get jg(y n + ~ k( y (51), we obtain jy n + ~ k( From (39) we see that the right-hand side of (54) is bounded by . Since the system _ y = A 1 y k( y )b 2 jyj ev N : (55) Now, suppose lim sup t!1 jy(t)j = &gt; 0. Then jyj ev 2. Since j k(y)j Ljyj, we have and using (56) and (57), we obtain j~yj ev 2(~-1 + -2 )L + -2 ffi : (58) (Note that if the right-hand side of (58) is 1 , then the inequality is trivial since we know from (52) that j~yj ev 1 .) From (53), (56), and (58), we have -2 ffi + N ffi &gt; N . However, from (55) we see that (60) still holds. So we established (60) in all cases. From (40) we then get jyj ev 2 Taking the lim sup t!1 of the left-hand side of (61), we have 1 2 + N("-2 + 1)ffi i.e. 2 N("-2 + 1)ffi. Substituting this into (58) and (61), we get j~yj ev ffi, and jyj ev 2 N("-2 + 1)ffi . So, if we take N = 2 N("-2 + 1)(1 + 2L(~-1 + -2 )) + -2 ; the conclusion follows. To complete the proof, we need to deal with the general case of m &gt; 1 inputs. This is done by induction on m, as in the proof in [14], and will be omitted here. 2 [1] Fuller, A.T., "In the large stability of relay and saturated control systems with linear controllers," Int. J.
