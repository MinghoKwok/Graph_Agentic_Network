ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1453 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221018:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Use of Mental Models for Constraining Index Learning in Experience-Based Design Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to..."
2. [Label_1] "A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to..."
3. [Label_0] "LINNEO A Classification Methodology for Ill-structured Domains Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover ..."
4. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
5. [Label_3] "Abstract Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the..."

Text to classify:
"Automatic Indexing, Retrieval and Reuse of Topologies in Architectual Layouts
Abstract: Former layouts contain much of the know-how of architects. A generic and automatic way to formalize this know-how in order to use it by a computer would save a lot of effort and money. However, there seems to be no such way. The only access to the know-how are the layouts themselves. Developing a generic software tool to reuse former layouts you cannot consider every part of the architectual domain or things like personal style. Tools used today only consider small parts of the architectual domain. Any personal style is ignored. Isn't it possible to build a basic tool which is adjusted by the content of the former layouts, but may be extended incremently by modeling as much of the domain as desirable? This paper will describe a reuse tool to perform this task focusing on topological and geometrical binary relations."
