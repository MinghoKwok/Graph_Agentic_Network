ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 622 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212614:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

5. [Label_6] "On learning hierarchical classifications Abstract: Many significant real-world classification tasks involve a large number of categories which are arr..."

Text to classify:
"CLASSIFICATION USING HIERARCHICAL MIXTURES OF EXPERTS
Abstract: There has recently been widespread interest in the use of multiple models for classification and regression in the statistics and neural networks communities. The Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) [1] has been successful in a number of regression problems, yielding significantly faster training through the use of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm. In this paper we extend the HME to classification and results are reported for three common classification benchmark tests: Exclusive-Or, N-input Parity and Two Spirals."
