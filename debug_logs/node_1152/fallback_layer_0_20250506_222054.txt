ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1152 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222054:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

3. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."

Text to classify:
"Fish and Shrink. A next step towards e-cient case retrieval in large scaled case bases
Abstract: Keywords: Case-Based Reasoning, case retrieval, case representation This paper deals with the retrieval of useful cases in case-based reasoning. It focuses on the questions of what "useful" could mean and how the search for useful cases can be organized. We present the new search algorithm Fish and Shrink that is able to search quickly through the case base, even if the aspects that deflne usefulness are spontaneously combined at query time. We compare Fish and Shrink to other algorithms and show that most of them make an implicit closed world assumption. We flnally refer to a realization of the presented idea in the context of the prototype of the FABEL-Project 1 . The scenery is as follows. Previously collected cases are stored in a large scaled case base. An expert describes his problem and gives the aspects in which the requested case should be similar. The similarity measure thus given spontaneously shall now be used to explore the case base within a short time, shall present a required number of cases and make sure that none of the other cases is more similar. The question is now how to prepare the previously collected cases and how to deflne a retrieval algorithm which is able to deal with sponta neously user-deflned similarity measures."
