ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1247 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222554:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"NIPS*97 The Efficiency and The Robustness of Natural Gradient Descent Learning Rule
Abstract: We have discovered a new scheme to represent the Fisher information matrix of a stochastic multi-layer perceptron. Based on this scheme, we have designed an algorithm to compute the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. When the input dimension n is much larger than the number of hidden neurons, the complexity of this algorithm is of order O(n 2 ) while the complexity of conventional algorithms for the same purpose is of order O(n 3 ). The inverse of the Fisher information matrix is used in the natural gradient descent algorithm to train single-layer or multi-layer perceptrons. It is confirmed by simulation that the natural gradient"
