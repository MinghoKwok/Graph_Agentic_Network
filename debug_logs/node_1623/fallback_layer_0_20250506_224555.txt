ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1623 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224555:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Neural Network Model for the Gold Market
Abstract: A neural network trend predictor for the gold bullion market is presented. A simple recurrent neural network was trained to recognize turning points in the gold market based on a to-date history of ten market indices. The network was tested on data that was held back from training, and a significant amount of predictive power was observed. The turning point predictions can be used to time transactions in the gold bullion and gold mining company stock index markets to obtain a significant paper profit during the test period. The training data consisted of daily closing prices for the ten input markets for a period of about five years. The turning point targets were labeled for the training phase without the help of a financial expert. Thus, this experiment shows that useful predictions can be made without the use of more extensive market data or knowledge."
