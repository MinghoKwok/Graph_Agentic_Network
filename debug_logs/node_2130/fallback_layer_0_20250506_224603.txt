ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2130 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224603:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to..."
2. [Label_0] "Use of Mental Models for Constraining Index Learning in Experience-Based Design Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to..."
3. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."
4. [Label_5] "First Order Regression Abstract: We present a new approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), to handling numerical information in Inductive Logic ..."
5. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."

Text to classify:
"Intelligent Gradient-Based Search of Incompletely Defined Design Spaces
Abstract: Gradient-based numerical optimization of complex engineering designs offers the promise of rapidly producing better designs. However, such methods generally assume that the objective function and constraint functions are continuous, smooth, and defined everywhere. Unfortunately, realistic simulators tend to violate these assumptions. We present a rule-based technique for intelligently computing gradients in the presence of such pathologies in the simulators, and show how this gradient computation method can be used as part of a gradient-based numerical optimization system. We tested the resulting system in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, and found that using rule-based gradients can decrease the cost of design space search by one or more orders of magnitude."
