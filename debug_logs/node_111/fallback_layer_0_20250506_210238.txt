ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 111 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210238:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Tau Net: A Neural Network for Modeling Temporal Variability
Abstract: The ability to handle temporal variation is important when dealing with real-world dynamic signals. In many applications, inputs do not come in as fixed-rate sequences, but rather as signals with time scales that can vary from one instance to the next; thus, modeling dynamic signals requires not only the ability to recognize sequences but also the ability to handle temporal changes in the signal. This paper discusses "Tau Net," a neural network for modeling dynamic signals, and its application to speech. In Tau Net, sequence learning is accomplished using a combination of prediction, recurrence and time-delay connections. Temporal variability is modeled by having adaptable time constants in the network, which are adjusted with respect to the prediction error. Adapting the time constants changes the time scale of the network, and the adapted value of the network's time constant provides a measure of temporal variation in the signal. Tau Net has been applied to several simple signals: sets of sine waves differing in frequency and in phase [2], a multidimensional signal representing the walking gait of children [3], and the energy contour of a simple speech utterance [11]. Tau Net has also been shown to work on a voicing distinction task using synthetic speech data [12]. In this paper, Tau Net is applied to two speaker-independent tasks, vowel recognition (of f/ae/,/iy/,/ux/g) and consonant recognition (of f/p/,/t/,/k/g) using speech data taken from the TIMIT database. It is shown that Tau Nets, trained on medium-rate tokens, achieved about the same performance as networks without time constants trained on tokens at all rates, and performed better than networks without time constants trained on medium-rate tokens. Our results demonstrate Tau Net's ability to identify vowels and consonants at variable speech rates by extrapolating to rates not represented in the training set."
