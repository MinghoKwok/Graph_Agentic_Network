ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 579 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212357:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Comparison of Kernel Estimators, Perceptrons, and Radial-Basis Functions for OCR and Speech Classification
Abstract: We compare kernel estimators, single and multi-layered perceptrons and radial-basis functions for the problems of classification of handwritten digits and speech phonemes. By taking two different applications and employing many techniques, we report here a two-dimensional study whereby a domain-independent assessment of these learning methods can be possible. We consider a feed-forward network with one hidden layer. As examples of the local methods, we use kernel estimators like k-nearest neighbor (k-nn), Parzen windows, generalized k-nn, and Grow and Learn (Condensed Nearest Neighbor). We have also considered fuzzy k-nn due to its similarity. As distributed networks, we use linear perceptron, pairwise separating linear perceptron, and multilayer perceptrons with sigmoidal hidden units. We also tested the radial-basis function network which is a combination of local and distributed networks. Four criteria are taken for comparison: Correct classification of the test set, network size, learning time, and the operational complexity. We found that perceptrons when the architecture is suitable, generalize better than local, memory-based kernel estimators but require longer training and more precise computation. Local networks are simple, learn very quickly and acceptably, but use more memory."
