ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 417 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213614:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Constructing Intermediate Concepts by Decomposition of Real Functions
Abstract: In learning from examples it is often useful to expand an attribute-vector representation by intermediate concepts. The usual advantage of such structuring of the learning problem is that it makes the learning easier and improves the comprehensibility of induced descriptions. In this paper, we develop a technique for discovering useful intermediate concepts when both the class and the attributes are real-valued. The technique is based on a decomposition method originally developed for the design of switching circuits and recently extended to handle incompletely specified multi-valued functions. It was also applied to machine learning tasks. In this paper, we introduce modifications, needed to decompose real functions and to present them in symbolic form. The method is evaluated on a number of test functions. The results show that the method correctly decomposes fairly complex functions. The decomposition hierarchy does not depend on a given repertoir of basic functions (background knowledge)."
