ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2237 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231153:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Specialization under Social Conditions in Shared Environments
Abstract: Specialist and generalist behaviors in populations of artificial neural networks are studied. A genetic algorithm is used to simulate evolution processes, and thereby to develop neural network control systems that exhibit specialist or generalist behaviors according to the fitness formula. With evolvable fitness formulae the evaluation measure is let free to evolve, and we obtain a co-evolution of the expressed behavior and the individual evolvable fitness formula. The use of evolvable fitness formulae lets us work in a dynamic fitness landscape, opposed to most work, that traditionally applies to static fitness landscapes, only. The role of competition in specialization is studied by letting the individuals live under social conditions in the same, shared environment and directly compete with each other. We find, that competition can act to provide population diversification in populations of organisms with individual evolvable fitness formulae."
