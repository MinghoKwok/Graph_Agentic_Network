ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 55 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210019:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "A STUDY OF CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING Abstract: Holland's analysis of the sources of power of genetic algorithms has served as guidanc..."
2. [Label_1] "The Application of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to the n=m=P=C max Flowshop Problem Abstract: Hard combinatorial problems in sequencing and scheduling..."
3. [Label_1] "Genetic Algorithms For Vertex Splitting in DAGs 1 Abstract: 1 This paper has been submitted to the 5th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms ..."
4. [Label_1] "Testing the Robustness of the Genetic Algorithm on the Floating Building Block Representation. Abstract: Recent studies on a floating building block r..."
5. [Label_1] "Type Inheritance in Strongly Typed Genetic Programming Abstract: This paper appears as chapter 18 of Kenneth E. Kinnear, Jr. and Peter J. Angeline, ed..."

Text to classify:
"A Comparison of Selection Schemes used in Genetic Algorithms
Abstract: TIK-Report Nr. 11, December 1995 Version 2 (2. Edition)"
