ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1216 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221821:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 8 examples

Text to classify:
"Evolutionary Programming and Evolution Strategies: Similarities and Differences
Abstract: Evolutionary Programming and Evolution Strategies, rather similar representatives of a class of probabilistic optimization algorithms gleaned from the model of organic evolution, are discussed and compared to each other with respect to similarities and differences of their basic components as well as their performance in some experimental runs. Theoretical results on global convergence, step size control for a strictly convex, quadratic function and an extension of the convergence rate theory for Evolution Strategies are presented and discussed with respect to their implications on Evolutionary Programming."
