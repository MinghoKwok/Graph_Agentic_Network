ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1026 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221414:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_2: 2 examples

Text to classify:
"Noise-Tolerant Parallel Learning of Geometric Concepts
Abstract: We present several efficient parallel algorithms for PAC-learning geometric concepts in a constant-dimensional space that are robust even against malicious misclassification noise of any rate less than 1=2. In particular we consider the class of geometric concepts defined by a polynomial number of (d 1)-dimensional hyperplanes against an arbitrary distribution where each hyperplane has a slope from a set of known slopes, and the class of geometric concepts defined by a polynomial number of (d 1)-dimensional hyperplanes (of unrestricted slopes) against a product distribution. Next we define a complexity measure of any set S of (d1)-dimensional surfaces that we call the variant of S and prove that the class of geometric concepts defined by surfaces of polynomial variant can be efficiently learned in parallel under a product distribution (even under malicious misclassifi-cation noise). Finally, we describe how boosting techniques can be used so that our algorithms' de pendence on * and ffi does not depend on d."
