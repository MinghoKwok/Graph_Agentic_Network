ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1827 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223004:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Efficient Algorithms for Inverting Evolution
Abstract: Evolution is a stochastic process which operates on the DNA of species. The evolutionary process leaves tell-tale signs in the DNA which can be used to construct phylogenies, or evolutionary trees, for a set of species. Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) methods seek the evolutionary tree which is most likely to have produced the DNA under consideration. While these methods are widely accepted and intellectually satisfying, they have been computationally intractable. In this paper, we address the intractability of MLE methods as follows. We introduce a metric on stochastic process models of evolution. We show that this metric is meaningful by proving that in order for any algorithm to distinguish between two stochatic models that are close according to this metric, it needs to be given a lot of observations. We complement this result with a simple and efficient algorithm for inverting the stochastic process of evolution, that is, for building the tree from observations on the DNA of the species. Our result can be viewed as a result on the PAC-learnability of the class of distributions produced by tree-like processes. Though there have been many heuristics suggested for this problem, our algorithm is the first one with a guaranteed convergence rate, and further, this rate is within a polynomial of the lower-bound rate we establish. Ours is also the the first polynomial-time algorithm which is guaranteed to converge at all to the correct tree."
