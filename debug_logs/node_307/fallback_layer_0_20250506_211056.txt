ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 307 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211056:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

4. [Label_2] "ce: [Tex89] <institution> Texas Instruments. </institution> <note> TMS320C30 C Compiler Reference Guide, 1989. Document Title: SPRU034A. </note> Abstr..."

"A Comparison of Full and Partial Predicated Execution Support for ILP Processors
Abstract: One can effectively utilize predicated execution to improve branch handling in instruction-level parallel processors. Although the potential benefits of predicated execution are high, the tradeoffs involved in the design of an instruction set to support predicated execution can be difficult. On one end of the design spectrum, architectural support for full predicated execution requires increasing the number of source operands for all instructions. Full predicate support provides for the most flexibility and the largest potential performance improvements. On the other end, partial predicated execution support, such as conditional moves, requires very little change to existing architectures. This paper presents a preliminary study to qualitatively and quantitatively address the benefit of full and partial predicated execution support. With our current compiler technology, we show that the compiler can use both partial and full predication to achieve speedup in large control-intensive programs. Some details of the code generation techniques are shown to provide insight into the benefit of going from partial to full predication. Preliminary experimental results are very encouraging: partial predication provides an average of 33% performance improvement for an 8-issue processor with no predicate support while full predication provides an additional 30% improvement."
