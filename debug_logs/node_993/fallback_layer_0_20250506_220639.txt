ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 993 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220639:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Efficient Estimation for the Cox Model with Interval Censoring
Abstract: The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the proportional hazards model with current status data is studied. It is shown that the MLE for the regression parameter is asymptotically normal with p n-convergence rate and achieves the information bound, even though the MLE for the baseline cumulative hazard function only converges at n 1=3 rate. Estimation of the asymptotic variance matrix for the MLE of the regression parameter is also considered. To prove our main results, we also establish a general theorem showing that the MLE of the finite dimensional parameter in a class of semiparametric models is asymptotically efficient even though the MLE of the infinite dimensional parameter converges at a rate slower than The results are illustrated by applying them to a data set from a tumoriginicity study. 1. Introduction In many survival analysis problems, we are interested in the p"
