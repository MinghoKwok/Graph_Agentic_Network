ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2336 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225652:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Fast Kohonen Net Implementation for
Abstract: We present an implementation of Kohonen Self-Organizing Feature Maps for the Spert-II vector microprocessor system. The implementation supports arbitrary neural map topologies and arbitrary neighborhood functions. For small networks, as used in real-world tasks, a single Spert-II board is measured to run Kohonen net classification at up to 208 million connections per second (MCPS). On a speech coding benchmark task, Spert-II performs on-line Kohonen net training at over 100 million connection updates per second (MCUPS). This represents almost a factor of 10 improvement compared to previously reported implementations. The asymptotic peak speed of the system is 213 MCPS and 213 MCUPS."
