ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2639 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233737:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"New Modes of Generalization in Perceptual Learning
Abstract: The learning of many visual perceptual tasks, such as motion discrimination, has been shown to be specific to the practiced stimulus, and new stimuli require re-learning from scratch [1-6]. This specificity, found in so many different tasks, supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning takes place in early visual cortical areas. In contrast, using a novel paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been shown to be specific, we found generalization: We trained subjects to discriminate the directions of moving dots, and verified that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. Moreover, after mastering the task with an easy stimulus, subjects who had practiced briefly to discriminate the easy stimulus in a new direction generalized to a difficult stimulus in that direction. This generalization demanded both the mastering and the brief practice. Thus learning in motion discrimination always generalizes to new stimuli. Learning is manifested in various forms: acceleration of learning rate, indirect transfer, or direct transfer [7, 8]. These results challenge existing theories of perceptual learning, and suggest a more complex picture in which learning takes place at multiple levels. Learning in biological systems is of great importance. But while cognitive learning (or "problem solving") is abrupt and generalizes to analogous problems, we appear to acquire our perceptual skills gradually and specifically: human subjects cannot generalize a perceptual discrimination skill to solve similar problems with different attributes. For example, in a discrimination task as described in Fig. 1, a subject who is trained to discriminate motion directions between 43:5 ffi and 46:5 ffi cannot use this skill to discriminate 133:5 ffi from 136:5 ffi . 1 Such specificity supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning embodies neuronal modifications in the brain's stimulus-specific cortical areas (e.g., visual area MT) [1-6]. In contrast to previous results of specificity, we will show, in three experiments, that learning in motion discrimination always generalizes. (1) When the task is easy, it generalizes to all directions after training in"
