ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1480 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223208:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning in the Presence of Prior Knowledge: A Case Study Using Model Calibration
Abstract: Computational models of natural systems often contain free parameters that must be set to optimize the predictive accuracy of the models. This process|called calibration|can be viewed as a form of supervised learning in the presence of prior knowledge. In this view, the fixed aspects of the model constitute the prior knowledge, and the goal is to learn correct values for the free parameters. We report on a series of attempts to learn parameter values for a global vegetation model called MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System) developed by our collaborator, Ron Neilson. Unfortunately, attempts to apply standard machine learning methods|specifically global error functions and gradient descent search|do not work with MAPSS, because the constraints introduced by the structure of the model (the prior knowledge) create a very difficult non-linear optimization problem. Successful calibration of MAPSS required taking a divide-and-conquer approach in which subsets of the parameters were calibrated while others were held constant. This approach was made possible by carefully selecting training sets that exercised only portions of the model and by designing error functions for each part that had desirable properties. The automated calibration tool that we have developed is currently being applied to calibrate MAPSS against a global climate data set."
