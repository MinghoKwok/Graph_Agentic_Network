ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 615 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212552:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
2. [Label_1] "Coevolving Communicative Behavior in a Linear Pursuer-Evader Game Abstract: The pursuer-evader (PE) game is recognized as an important domain in which..."
3. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
4. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
5. [Label_4] "KnightCap: A chess program that learns by combining TD() with minimax search Abstract: In this paper we present TDLeaf(), a variation on the TD() algo..."

Text to classify:
"Efficient Algorithms for Learning to Play Repeated Games Against Computationally Bounded Adversaries
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently learning to play a game optimally against an unknown adversary chosen from a computationally bounded class. We both contribute to the line of research on playing games against finite automata, and expand the scope of this research by considering new classes of adversaries. We introduce the natural notions of games against recent history adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple boolean formula on the recent history of play), and games against statistical adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple function of the statistics of the entire history of play). In both cases we give efficient algorithms for learning to play penny-matching and a more difficult game called contract . We also give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata, an efficient algorithm for learning to play any game against any finite automata with probabilistic actions and low cover time."
