ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1085 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221719:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Reports of the GMU Machine Learning and Inference HOW DID AQ FACE THE EAST-WEST CHALLENGE?
Abstract: The East-West Challenge is the title of the second international competition of machine learning programs, organized in the Fall 1994 by Donald Michie, Stephen Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan from Oxford University. The goal of the competition was to solve the TRAINS problems, that is to discover the simplest classification rules for train-like structured objects. The rule complexity was judged by a Prolog program that counted the number of various components in the rule expressed in the from of Prolog Horn clauses. There were 65 entries from several countries submitted to the competition. The GMU teams entry was generated by three members of the AQ family of learning programs: AQ-DT, INDUCE and AQ17-HCI. The paper analyses the results obtained by these programs and compares them to those obtained by other learning programs. It also presents ideas for further research that were inspired by the competition. One of these ideas is a challenge to the machine learning community to develop a measure of knowledge complexity that would adequately capture the cognitive complexity of knowledge. A preliminary measure of such cognitive complexity, called Ccomplexity, different from the Prolog-complexity (P-complexity) used in the competition, is briefly discussed. The authors thank Professors Donald Michie, Steve Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan for organizing the West-East Challenge competition of machine learning programs, which provided us with a stimulating challenge for our learning programs and inspired new ideas for improving them. The authors also thank Nabil Allkharouf and Ali Hadjarian for their help and suggestions in the efforts to solve problems posed by the competition.
