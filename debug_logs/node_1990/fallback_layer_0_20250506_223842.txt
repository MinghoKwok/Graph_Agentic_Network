ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1990 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223842:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T..."
2. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."
3. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_2] "Tau Net: A Neural Network for Modeling Temporal Variability Abstract: The ability to handle temporal variation is important when dealing with real-wor..."
5. [Label_2] "Word Perfect Corp. LIA: A Location-Independent Transformation for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2 Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a f..."

Text to classify:
"A FIXED SIZE STORAGE O(n 3 TIME COMPLEXITY LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR FULLY RECURRENT CONTINUALLY RUNNING
Abstract: The RTRL algorithm for fully recurrent continually running networks (Robinson and Fallside, 1987)(Williams and Zipser, 1989) requires O(n 4 ) computations per time step, where n is the number of non-input units. I describe a method suited for on-line learning which computes exactly the same gradient and requires fixed-size storage of the same order but has an average time complexity 1 per time step of O(n 3 )."
