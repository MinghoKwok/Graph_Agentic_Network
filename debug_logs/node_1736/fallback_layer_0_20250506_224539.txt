ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1736 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224539:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolving Cooperation Strategies
Abstract: The identification, design, and implementation of strategies for cooperation is a central research issue in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). We propose a novel approach to the construction of cooperation strategies for a group of problem solvers based on the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm. GPs are a class of adaptive algorithms used to evolve solution structures that optimize a given evaluation criterion. Our approach is based on designing a representation for cooperation strategies that can be manipulated by GPs. We present results from experiments in the predator-prey domain, which has been extensively studied as a easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation problem domain. The key aspect of our approach is the minimal reliance on domain knowledge and human intervention in the construction of good cooperation strategies. Promising comparison results with prior systems lend credence to the viability of this ap proach."
