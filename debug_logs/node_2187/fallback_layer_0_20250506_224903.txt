ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2187 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224903:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Robust performance and adaptation using receding horizon H 1 control of time varying systems. Abstract: In this paper we construct suboptimal H 1 cont..."
2. [Label_2] "Avoiding Saturation By Trajectory Reparameterization Abstract: The problem of trajectory tracking in the presence of input constraints is considered. ..."
3. [Label_4] "Towards a Reactive Critic Abstract: In this paper we propose a reactive critic, that is able to respond to changing situations. We will explain why th..."
4. [Label_4] "Improving Policies without Measuring Merits Abstract: Performing policy iteration in dynamic programming should only require knowledge of relative rat..."
5. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."

Text to classify:
""UNIVERSAL" CONSTRUCTION OF ARTSTEIN'S THEOREM ON NONLINEAR STABILIZATION 1
Abstract: Report SYCON-89-03 ABSTRACT This note presents an explicit proof of the theorem -due to Artstein- which states that the existence of a smooth control-Lyapunov function implies smooth stabilizability. More- over, the result is extended to the real-analytic and rational cases as well. The proof uses a "universal" formula given by an algebraic function of Lie derivatives; this formula originates in the solution of a simple Riccati equation."
