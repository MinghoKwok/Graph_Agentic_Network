ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 673 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215537:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 2 examples

Text to classify:
"Increasing Consensus Accuracy in DNA Fragment Assemblies by Incorporating Fluorescent Trace Representations
Abstract: We present a new method for determining the consensus sequence in DNA fragment assemblies. The new method, Trace-Evidence, directly incorporates aligned ABI trace information into consensus calculations via our previously described representation, TraceData Classifications. The new method extracts and sums evidence indicated by the representation to determine consensus calls. Using the Trace-Evidence method results in automatically produced consensus sequences that are more accurate and less ambiguous than those produced with standard majority- voting methods. Additionally, these improvements are achieved with less coverage than required by the standard methods using Trace-Evidence and a coverage of only three, error rates are as low as those with a coverage of over ten sequences."
