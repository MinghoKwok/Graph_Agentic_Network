ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1689 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224925:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Selection for Wandering Behavior in a Small Robot
Abstract: We have evolved artificial neural networks to control the wandering behavior of small robots. The task was to touch as many squares in a grid as possible during a fixed period of time. A number of the simulated robots were embodied in small Lego (Trademark) robot, controlled by a Motorola (Trademark) 6811 processor; and their performance was compared to the simulations. We observed that: (a) evolution was an effective means to program control; (b) progress was characterized by sharply stepped periods of improvement, separated by periods of stasis that corresponded to levels of behavioral/computational complexity; and (c) the simulated and realized robots behaved quite similarly, the realized robots in some cases outperforming the simulated ones. Introducing random noise to the simulations improved the fit somewhat (from 0.73 to 0.79). Hybrid simulated/embodied selection regimes for evolutionary robots are discussed."
