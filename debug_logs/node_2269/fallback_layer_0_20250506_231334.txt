ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2269 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231334:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Some Steps Towards a Form of Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming
Abstract: Genetic Programming is a method of program discovery consisting of a special kind of genetic algorithm capable of operating on nonlinear chromosomes (parse trees) representing programs and an interpreter which can run the programs being optimised. This paper describes PDGP (Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming), a new form of genetic programming which is suitable for the development of fine-grained parallel programs. PDGP is based on a graph-like representation for parallel programs which is manipulated by crossover and mutation operators which guarantee the syntactic correctness of the offspring. The paper describes these operators and reports some preliminary results obtained with this paradigm."
