ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1897 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223347:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_6] "An Interactive Model of Teaching Abstract: Previous teaching models in the learning theory community have been batch models. That is, in these models ..."
3. [Label_5] "Learning Trees and Rules with Set-valued Features Abstract: In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length "feature vectors", the c..."
4. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."

"On Learning Visual Concepts and DNF Formulae
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning DNF formulae in the mistake-bound and the PAC models. We develop a new approach, which is called polynomial explainability, that is shown to be useful for learning some new subclasses of DNF (and CNF) formulae that were not known to be learnable before. Unlike previous learnability results for DNF (and CNF) formulae, these subclasses are not limited in the number of terms or in the number of variables per term; yet, they contain the subclasses of k-DNF and k-term-DNF (and the corresponding classes of CNF) as special cases. We apply our DNF results to the problem of learning visual concepts and obtain learning algorithms for several natural subclasses of visual concepts that appear to have no natural boolean counterpart. On the other hand, we show that learning some other natural subclasses of visual concepts is as hard as learning the class of all DNF formulae. We also consider the robustness of these results under various types of noise."
