ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2417 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230118:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."
2. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_3] "Monte Carlo Implementation of Gaussian Process Models for Bayesian Regression and Classification Abstract: Technical Report No. 9702, Department of St..."
5. [Label_1] "Unsupervised Learning with the Soft-Means Algorithm Abstract: This note describes a useful adaptation of the `peak seeking' regime used in unsupervise..."

Text to classify:
"Choice of Basis for Laplace Approximation
Abstract: Maximum a posteriori optimization of parameters and the Laplace approximation for the marginal likelihood are both basis-dependent methods. This note compares two choices of basis for models parameterized by probabilities, showing that it is possible to improve on the traditional choice, the probability simplex, by transforming to the `softmax' basis."
