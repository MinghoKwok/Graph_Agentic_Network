ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1352 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222525:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"FONN: Combining First Order Logic with Connectionist Learning
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network architecture that can manage structured data and refine knowledge bases expressed in a first order logic language. The presented framework is well suited to classification problems in which concept de scriptions depend upon numerical features of the data. In fact, the main goal of the neural architecture is that of refining the numerical part of the knowledge base, without changing its structure. In particular, we discuss a method to translate a set of classification rules into neural computation units. Here, we focus our attention on the translation method and on algorithms to refine network weights on struc tured data. The classification theory to be refined can be manually handcrafted or automatically acquired by a symbolic relational learning system able to deal with numerical features. As a matter of fact, the primary goal is to bring into a neural network architecture the capability of dealing with structured data of unrestricted size, by allowing to dynamically bind the classification rules to different items occur ring in the input data. An extensive experimentation on a challenging artificial case study shows that the network converges quite fastly and generalizes much better than propositional learners on an equivalent task definition."
