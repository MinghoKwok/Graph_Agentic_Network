ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 365 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213331:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Radial basis function approximation: from gridded centers to scattered centers
Abstract: The paper studies L 1 (IR d )-norm approximations from a space spanned by a discrete set of translates of a basis function . Attention here is restricted to functions whose Fourier transform is smooth on IR d n0, and has a singularity at the origin. Examples of such basis functions are the thin-plate splines and the multiquadrics, as well as other types of radial basis functions that are employed in Approximation Theory. The above approximation problem is well-understood in case the set of points ffi used for translating forms a lattice in IR d , and many optimal and quasi-optimal approximation schemes can already be found in the literature. In contrast, only few, mostly specific, results are known for a set ffi of scattered points. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general tool for extending approximation schemes that use integer translates of a basis function to the non-uniform case. We introduce a single, relatively simple, conversion method that preserves the approximation orders provided by a large number of schemes presently in the literature (more precisely, to almost all "stationary schemes"). In anticipation of future introduction of new schemes for uniform grids, an effort is made to impose only a few mild conditions on the function , which still allow for a unified error analysis to hold. In the course of the discussion here, the recent results of [BuDL] on scattered center approximation are reproduced and improved upon."
