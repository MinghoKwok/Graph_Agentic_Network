ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 898 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214052:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Abstract: MIT Computational Cognitive Science Technical Report 9701 Abstract We describe variational approximation methods for efficient probabilistic reasoning, applying these methods to the problem of diagnostic inference in the QMR-DT database. The QMR-DT database is a large-scale belief network based on statistical and expert knowledge in internal medicine. The size and complexity of this network render exact probabilistic diagnosis infeasible for all but a small set of cases. This has hindered the development of the QMR- DT network as a practical diagnostic tool and has hindered researchers from exploring and critiquing the diagnostic behavior of QMR. In this paper we describe how variational approximation methods can be applied to the QMR network, resulting in fast diagnostic inference. We evaluate the accuracy of our methods on a set of standard diagnostic cases and compare to stochastic sampling methods."
