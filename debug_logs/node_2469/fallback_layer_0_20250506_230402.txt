ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2469 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230402:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Incremental Pruning: A Simple, Fast, Exact Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes Abstract: Most exact algorithms for general po..."
2. [Label_5] "Incremental Reduced Error Pruning Abstract: This paper outlines some problems that may occur with Reduced Error Pruning in relational learning algorit..."
3. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
5. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning with Modular Neural Networks for Control Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods can be applied to control problems with the o..."

Text to classify:
"Extended Kalman filter in recurrent neural network training and pruning
Abstract: Recently, extended Kalman filter (EKF) based training has been demonstrated to be effective in neural network training. However, its conjunction with pruning methods such as weight decay and optimal brain damage (OBD) has not yet been studied. In this paper, we will elucidate the method of EKF training and propose a pruning method which is based on the results obtained by EKF training. These combined training pruning method is applied to a time series prediction problem."
