ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2542 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230754:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
2. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."

Text to classify:
"Worst-Case Identification of Nonlinear Fading Memory Systems
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of asymptotic identification for a class of fading memory systems in the presence of bounded noise is studied. For any experiment, the worst-case error is characterized in terms of the diameter of the worst-case uncertainty set. Optimal inputs that minimize the radius of uncertainty are studied and characterized. Finally, a convergent algorithm that does not require knowledge of the noise upper bound is furnished. The algorithm is based on interpolating data with spline functions, which are shown to be well suited for identification in the presence of bounded noise; more so than other basis functions such as polynomials. The methods as well as the results are quite general and are applicable to a larger variety of settings."
