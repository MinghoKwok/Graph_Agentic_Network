ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 953 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214350:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

4. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."

"Behavior Hierarchy for Autonomous Mobile Robots: Fuzzy-behavior modulation and evolution
Abstract: Realization of autonomous behavior in mobile robots, using fuzzy logic control, requires formulation of rules which are collectively responsible for necessary levels of intelligence. Such a collection of rules can be conveniently decomposed and efficiently implemented as a hierarchy of fuzzy-behaviors. This article describes how this can be done using a behavior-based architecture. A behavior hierarchy and mechanisms of control decision-making are described. In addition, an approach to behavior coordination is described with emphasis on evolution of fuzzy coordination rules using the genetic programming (GP) paradigm. Both conventional GP and steady-state GP are applied to evolve a fuzzy-behavior for sensor-based goal-seeking. The usefulness of the behavior hierarchy, and partial design by GP, is evident in performance results of simulated autonomous navigation."
