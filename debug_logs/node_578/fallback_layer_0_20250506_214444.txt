ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 578 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214444:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO SOLVING THE GENERAL UTILITY PROBLEM IN SPEEDUP LEARNING
Abstract: The utility problem in speedup learning describes a common behavior of machine learning methods: the eventual degradation of performance due to increasing amounts of learned knowledge. The shape of the learning curve (cost of using a learning method vs. number of training examples) over several domains suggests a parameterized model relating performance to the amount of learned knowledge and a mechanism to limit the amount of learned knowledge for optimal performance. Many recent approaches to avoiding the utility problem in speedup learning rely on sophisticated utility measures and significant numbers of training data to accurately estimate the utility of control knowledge. Empirical results presented here and elsewhere indicate that a simple selection strategy of retaining all control rules derived from a training problem explanation quickly defines an efficient set of control knowledge from few training problems. This simple selection strategy provides a low-cost alternative to example-intensive approaches for improving the speed of a problem solver. Experimentation illustrates the existence of a minimum (representing least cost) in the learning curve which is reached after a few training examples. Stress is placed on controlling the amount of learned knowledge as opposed to which knowledge. An attempt is also made to relate domain characteristics to the shape of the learning curve."
