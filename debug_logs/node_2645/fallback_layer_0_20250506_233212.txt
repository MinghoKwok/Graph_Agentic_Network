ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2645 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233212:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"CBR on Semi-structured Documents: The ExperienceBook and the FAllQ Project
Abstract: In this article, we present a case-based approach on flexible query answering systems in two different application areas: The ExperienceBook supports technical diagnosis in the field of system administration. In the FAllQ project we use our CBR system for document retrieval in an industrial setting. The objective of these systems is to manage knowledge stored in less structured documents. The internal case memory is implemented as a Case Retrieval Net. This allows to handle large case bases with an efficient retrieval process. In order to provide multi user access we chose the client server model combined with a web interface."
