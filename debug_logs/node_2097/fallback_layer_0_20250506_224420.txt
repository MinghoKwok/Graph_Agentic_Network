ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2097 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224420:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_3] "On the Logic of Iterated Belief Revision Abstract: We show in this paper that the AGM postulates are too week to ensure the rational preservation of c..."
2. [Label_0] "AN INCREMENTAL LEARNING MODEL FOR COMMONSENSE REASONING Abstract:"
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_3] "Abstract Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the..."
5. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."

"Impediments to Universal Preference-Based Default Theories
Abstract: Research on nonmonotonic and default reasoning has identified several important criteria for preferring alternative default inferences. The theories of reasoning based on each of these criteria may uniformly be viewed as theories of rational inference, in which the reasoner selects maximally preferred states of belief. Though researchers have noted some cases of apparent conflict between the preferences supported by different theories, it has been hoped that these special theories of reasoning may be combined into a universal logic of nonmonotonic reasoning. We show that the different categories of preferences conflict more than has been realized, and adapt formal results from social choice theory to prove that every universal theory of default reasoning will violate at least one reasonable principle of rational reasoning. Our results can be interpreted as demonstrating that, within the preferential framework, we cannot expect much improvement on the rigid lexicographic priority mechanisms that have been proposed for conflict resolution."
