ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2366 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231835:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Choice of Thresholds for Wavelet Shrinkage Estimate of the Spectrum fff j g are level-dependent
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the log spectrum of a stationary Gaussian time series by thresholding the empirical wavelet coefficients. We propose the use of thresholds t j;n depending on sample size n, wavelet basis and resolution level j. At fine resolution levels (j = 1; 2; :::), we propose The purpose of this thresholding level is to make the reconstructed log-spectrum as nearly noise-free as possible. In addition to being pleasant from a visual point of view, the noise-free character leads to attractive theoretical properties over a wide range of smoothness assumptions. Previous proposals set much smaller thresholds and did not enjoy these properties. t j;n = ff j log n;"
