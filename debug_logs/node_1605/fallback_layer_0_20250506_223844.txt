ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1605 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223844:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning from the Environment by Experimentation: The Need for Few and Informative Examples
Abstract: An intelligent system must be able to adapt and learn to correct and update its model of the environment incrementally and deliberately. In complex environments that have many parameters and where interactions have a cost, sampling the possible range of states to test the results of action executions is not a practical approach. We present a practical approach based on continuous and selective interaction with the environment that pinpoints the type of fault in the domain knowledge that causes any unexpected behavior of the environment, and resorts to experimentation when additional information is needed to correct the system's knowledge."
