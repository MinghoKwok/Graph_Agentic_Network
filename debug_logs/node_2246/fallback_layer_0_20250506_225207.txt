ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2246 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225207:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning to model sequences generated by switching distributions
Abstract: We study efficient algorithms for solving the following problem, which we call the switching distributions learning problem. A sequence S = 1 2 : : : n , over a finite alphabet S is generated in the following way. The sequence is a concatenation of K runs, each of which is a consecutive subsequence. Each run is generated by independent random draws from a distribution ~p i over S, where ~p i is an element in a set of distributions f~p 1 ; : : : ; ~p N g. The learning algorithm is given this sequence and its goal is to find approximations of the distributions ~p 1 ; : : : ; ~p N , and give an approximate segmentation of the sequence into its constituting runs. We give an efficient algorithm for solving this problem and show conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to work with high probability."
