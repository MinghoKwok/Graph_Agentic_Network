ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1855 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225815:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_0: 8 examples
- Label_3: 1 examples
- Label_5: 3 examples

Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
3. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
4. [Label_0] "Use of Mental Models for Constraining Index Learning in Experience-Based Design Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to..."
5. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."

Text to classify:
"Applying Case Retrieval Nets to Diagnostic Tasks in Technical Domains
Abstract: This paper presents Objectdirected Case Retrieval Nets, a memory model developed for an application of Case-Based Reasoning to the task of technical diagnosis. The key idea is to store cases, i.e. observed symptoms and diagnoses, in a network and to enhance this network with an object model encoding knowledge about the devices in the application domain."
