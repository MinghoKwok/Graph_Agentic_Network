ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1377 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220617:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
3. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
4. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
5. [Label_5] "on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning..."

Text to classify:
"The case for cases: a call for purity in case-based reasoning inherently more difficult than
Abstract: A basic premise of case-based reasoning (CBR) is that it involves reasoning from cases, which are representations of real episodes, rather than from rules, which are facts and if then structures with no stated connection to any real episodes. In fact, most CBR systems do not reason directly from cases | rather they reason from abstractions or simplifications of cases. In this paper, we argue for "pure" case-based reasoning, i.e., reasoning from representations that are both concrete and reasonably complete. We claim that working from representations that satisfy these criteria We illustrate our argument with examples from three previous systems, chef, swale, and hypo, as well as from cookie, a CBR system being developed by the first author."
