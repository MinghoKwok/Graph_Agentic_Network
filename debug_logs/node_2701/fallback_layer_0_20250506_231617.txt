ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2701 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231617:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_2] "Tau Net: A Neural Network for Modeling Temporal Variability Abstract: The ability to handle temporal variation is important when dealing with real-wor..."
2. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."
3. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
4. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
5. [Label_6] "Feature Generation for Sequence Categorization Abstract: The problem of sequence categorization is to generalize from a corpus of labeled sequences pr..."

Text to classify:
"Simple Synchrony Networks Learning to Parse Natural Language with Temporal Synchrony Variable Binding
Abstract: The Simple Synchrony Network (SSN) is a new connectionist architecture, incorporating the insights of Temporal Synchrony Variable Binding (TSVB) into Simple Recurrent Networks. The use of TSVB means SSNs can output representations of structures, and can learn generalisations over the constituents of these structures (as required by systematicity). This paper describes the SSN and an associated training algorithm, and demonstrates SSNs' generalisation abilities through results from training SSNs to parse real natural language sentences."
