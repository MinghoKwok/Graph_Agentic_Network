ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 940 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220942:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_1: 10 examples
- Label_5: 2 examples

Text to classify:
"Signal Path Oriented Approach for Generation of Dynamic Process Models
Abstract: The article at hand discusses a tool for automatic generation of structured models for complex dynamic processes by means of genetic programming. In contrast to other techniques which use genetic programming to find an appropriate arithmetic expression in order to describe the input-output behaviour of a process, this tool is based on a block oriented approach with a transparent description of signal paths. A short survey on other techniques for computer based system identification is given and the basic concept of SMOG (Structured MOdel Generator) is described. Furthermore latest extensions of the system are presented in detail, including automatically defined sub-models and quali tative fitness criteria."
