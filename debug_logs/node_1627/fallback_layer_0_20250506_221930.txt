ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1627 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221930:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "LINNEO A Classification Methodology for Ill-structured Domains Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover ..."
2. [Label_5] "A Comparison of Pruning Methods for Relational Concept Learning Abstract: Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning are two standard methods of dealing with noise ..."
3. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
4. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
5. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."

Text to classify:
"Inductive Learning of Characteristic Concept Descriptions from Small Sets of Classified Examples
Abstract: This paper presents a novel idea to the problem of learning concept descriptions from examples. Whereas most existing approaches rely on a large number of classified examples, the approach presented in the paper is aimed at being applicable when only a few examples are classified as positive (and negative) instances of a concept. The approach tries to take advantage of the information which can be induced from descriptions of unclassified objects using a conceptual clustering algorithm. The system Cola is described and results of applying Cola in two real-world domains are presented."
