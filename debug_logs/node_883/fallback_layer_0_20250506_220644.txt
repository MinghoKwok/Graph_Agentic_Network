ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 883 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220644:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Preprocessing Model for Integrating CBR and Prototype-Based Neural Networks
Abstract: Some important factors that play a major role in determining the performances of a CBR (Case-Based Reasoning) system are the complexity and the accuracy of the retrieval phase. Both flat memory and inductive approaches suffer from serious drawbacks. In the first approach, the search time increases when dealing with large scale memory base, while in the second one the modification of the case memory becomes very complex because of its sophisticated architecture. In this paper, we show how we construct a simple efficient indexing system structure. The idea is to construct a case hierarchy with two levels of memory: the lower level contains cases organised into groups of similar cases, while the upper level contains prototypes. each prototype represents one group of cases. This smaller memory is used during the retrieval phase. Prototype construction is achieved by means of an incremental prototype-based NN (Neural Network). We show that this mode of CBR-NN coupling is a preprocessing one where the neural network serves as an indexing system to the"
