ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2322 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232233:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"PHONETIC CLASSIFICATION OF TIMIT SEGMENTS PREPROCESSED WITH LYON'S COCHLEAR MODEL USING A SUPERVISED/UNSUPERVISED HYBRID NEURAL NETWORK
Abstract: We report results on vowel and stop consonant recognition with tokens extracted from the TIMIT database. Our current system differs from others doing similar tasks in that we do not use any specific time normalization techniques. We use a very detailed biologically motivated input representation of the speech tokens - Lyon's cochlear model as implemented by Slaney [20]. This detailed, high dimensional representation, known as a cochleagram, is classified by either a back-propagation or by a hybrid supervised/unsupervised neural network classifier. The hybrid network is composed of a biologically motivated unsupervised network and a supervised back-propagation network. This approach produces results comparable to those obtained by others without the addition of time normalization."
