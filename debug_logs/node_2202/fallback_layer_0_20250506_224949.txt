ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2202 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224949:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"An Evolutionary Approach to Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Abstract: The paper reports on the application of genetic algorithms, probabilistic search algorithms based on the model of organic evolution, to NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the subset sum, maximum cut, and minimum tardy task problems are considered. Except for the fitness function, no problem-specific changes of the genetic algorithm are required in order to achieve results of high quality even for the problem instances of size 100 used in the paper. For constrained problems, such as the subset sum and the minimum tardy task, the constraints are taken into account by incorporating a graded penalty term into the fitness function. Even for large instances of these highly multimodal optimization problems, an iterated application of the genetic algorithm is observed to find the global optimum within a number of runs. As the genetic algorithm samples only a tiny fraction of the search space, these results are quite encouraging."
