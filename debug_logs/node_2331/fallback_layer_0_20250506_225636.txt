ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2331 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225636:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

4. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."

Text to classify:
"Improved Hoeffding-Style Performance Guarantees for Accurate Classifiers
Abstract: We extend Hoeffding bounds to develop superior probabilistic performance guarantees for accurate classifiers. The original Hoeffding bounds on classifier accuracy depend on the accuracy itself as a parameter. Since the accuracy is not known a priori, the parameter value that gives the weakest bounds is used. We present a method that loosely bounds the accuracy using the old method and uses the loose bound as an improved parameter value for tighter bounds. We show how to use the bounds in practice, and we generalize the bounds for individual classifiers to form uniform bounds over multiple classifiers."
