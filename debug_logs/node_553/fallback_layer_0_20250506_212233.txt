ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 553 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212233:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Theory of Correlations in Stochastic Neural Networks Abstract: One of the main experimental tools in probing the interactions between neurons has been..."
2. [Label_2] "A Mixture of Experts Model Exhibiting Prosopagnosia Abstract: A considerable body of evidence from prosopagnosia, a deficit in face recognition dissoc..."
3. [Label_0] "Context-Sensitive Feature Selection for Lazy Learners Abstract:"
4. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."
5. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"

"Object Selection Based on Oscillatory Correlation
Abstract: 1 Technical Report: OSU-CISRC-12/96 - TR67, 1996 Abstract One of the classical topics in neural networks is winner-take-all (WTA), which has been widely used in unsupervised (competitive) learning, cortical processing, and attentional control. Because of global connectivity, WTA networks, however, do not encode spatial relations in the input, and thus cannot support sensory and perceptual processing where spatial relations are important. We propose a new architecture that maintains spatial relations between input features. This selection network builds on LEGION (Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Networks) dynamics and slow inhibition. In an input scene with many objects (patterns), the network selects the largest object. This system can be easily adjusted to select several largest objects, which then alternate in time. We further show that a twostage selection network gains efficiency by combining selection with parallel removal of noisy regions. The network is applied to select the most salient object in real images. As a special case, the selection network without local excitation gives rise to a new form of oscillatory WTA."
