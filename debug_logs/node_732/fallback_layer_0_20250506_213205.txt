ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 732 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213205:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Statistical Queries and Faulty PAC Oracles
Abstract: In this paper we study learning in the PAC model of Valiant [18] in which the example oracle used for learning may be faulty in one of two ways: either by misclassifying the example or by distorting the distribution of examples. We first consider models in which examples are misclassified. Kearns [12] recently showed that efficient learning in a new model using statistical queries is a sufficient condition for PAC learning with classification noise. We show that efficient learning with statistical queries is sufficient for learning in the PAC model with malicious error rate proportional to the required statistical query accuracy. One application of this result is a new lower bound for tolerable malicious error in learning monomials of k literals. This is the first such bound which is independent of the number of irrelevant attributes n. We also use the statistical query model to give sufficient conditions for using distribution specific algorithms on distributions outside their prescribed domains. A corollary of this result expands the class of distributions on which we can weakly learn monotone Boolean formulae. We also consider new models of learning in which examples are not chosen according to the distribution on which the learner will be tested. We examine three variations of distribution noise and give necessary and sufficient conditions for polynomial time learning with such noise. We show containments and separations between the various models of faulty oracles. Finally, we examine hypothesis boosting algorithms in the context of learning with distribution noise, and show that Schapire's result regarding the strength of weak learnabil-ity [17] is in some sense tight in requiring the weak learner to be nearly distribution free."
