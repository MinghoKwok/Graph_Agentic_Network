ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 989 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220627:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Finding Compact and Sparse Distributed Representations of Visual Images
Abstract: Some recent work has investigated the dichotomy between compact coding using dimensionality reduction and sparse distributed coding in the context of understanding biological information processing. We introduce an artificial neural network which self organises on the basis of simple Hebbian learning and negative feedback of activation and show that it is capable of both forming compact codings of data distributions and also of identifying filters most sensitive to sparse distributed codes. The network is extremely simple and its biological relevance is investigated via its response to a set of images which are typical of everyday life. However, an analysis of the network's identification of the filter for sparse coding reveals that this coding may not be globally optimal and that there exists an innate limiting factor which cannot be transcended."
