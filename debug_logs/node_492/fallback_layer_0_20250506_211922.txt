ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 492 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211922:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Approximating Optimal Policies for Partially Observable Stochastic Domains
Abstract: The problem of making optimal decisions in uncertain conditions is central to Artificial Intelligence. If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action, or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning methods, a combination that was very effective in our test cases."
