ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2111 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230519:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Artificial Life as Theoretical Biology: How to do real science with computer simulation
Abstract: Artificial Life (A-Life) research offers, among other things, a new style of computer simulation for understanding biological systems and processes. But most current A-Life work does not show enough methodological sophistication to count as good theoretical biology. As a first step towards developing a stronger methodology for A-Life, this paper (1) identifies some methodological pitfalls arising from the `computer science inuence' in A-Life, (2) suggests some methodological heuristics for A-Life as theoretical biology, (3) notes the strengths of A-Life methods versus previous research methods in biology, (4) examines some open questions in theoretical biology that may benefit from A-Life simulation, and (5) argues that the debate over `Strong A-Life' is not relevant to A-Life's utility for theoretical biology. 1 Introduction: Simulating our way into the Dark Continent"
