ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1518 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221343:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Feature selection through Functional Links with Evolutionary Computation for Neural Networks
Abstract: In this paper we describe different ways to select and transform features using evolutionary computation. The features are intended to serve as inputs to a feedforward network. The first way is the selection of features using a standard genetic algorithm, and the solution found specifies whether a certain feature should be present or not. We show that for the prediction of unemployment rates in various European countries, this is a succesfull approach. In fact, this kind of selection of features is a special case of so-called functional links. Functional links transform the input pattern space to a new pattern space. As functional links one can use polynomials, or more general functions. Both can be found using evolutionary computation. Polynomial functional links are found by evolving a coding of the powers of the polynomial. For symbolic functions we can use genetic programming. Genetic programming finds the symbolic functions that are to be applied to the inputs. We compare the workings of the latter two methods on two artificial datasets, and on a real-world medical image dataset."
