ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1309 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222910:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Formalization of Explanation-Based Macro-operator Learning
Abstract: In spite of the popularity of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL), its theoretical basis is not well-understood. Using a generalization of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning to problem solving domains, this paper formalizes two forms of Explanation-Based Learning of macro-operators and proves the sufficient conditions for their success. These two forms of EBL, called "Macro Caching" and "Serial Parsing," respectively exhibit two distinct sources of power or "bias": the sparseness of the solution space and the decomposability of the problem-space. The analysis shows that exponential speedup can be achieved when either of these biases is suitable for a domain. Somewhat surprisingly, it also shows that computing the preconditions of the macro-operators is not necessary to obtain these speedups. The theoretical results are confirmed by experiments in the domain of Eight Puzzle. Our work suggests that the best way to address the utility problem in EBL is to implement a bias which exploits the problem-space structure of the set of domains that one is interested in learning."
