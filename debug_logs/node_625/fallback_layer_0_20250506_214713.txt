ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 625 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214713:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Statistical Biases in Backpropagation Learning  Keywords: Cognitive Science, Pattern recognition
Abstract: The paper investigates the statistical effects which may need to be exploited in supervised learning. It notes that these effects can be classified according to their conditionality and their order and proposes that learning algorithms will typically have some form of bias towards particular classes of effect. It presents the results of an empirical study of the statistical bias of backpropagation. The study involved applying the algorithm to a wide range of learning problems using a variety of different internal architectures. The results of the study revealed that backpropagation has a very specific bias in the general direction of statistical rather than relational effects. The paper shows how the existence of this bias effectively constitutes a weakness in the algorithm's ability to discount noise."
