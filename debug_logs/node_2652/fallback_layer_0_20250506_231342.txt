ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2652 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231342:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to..."
2. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
3. [Label_5] "Abstract Abstract: This paper is a scientific comparison of two code generation techniques with identical goals generation of the best possible softwa..."
4. [Label_5] "First Order Regression Abstract: We present a new approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), to handling numerical information in Inductive Logic ..."
5. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."

"Knowledge-Based Re-engineering of Legacy Programs for Robustness in Automated Design
Abstract: Systems for automated design optimization of complex real-world objects can, in principle, be constructed by combining domain-independent numerical routines with existing domain-specific analysis and simulation programs. Unfortunately, such legacy analysis codes are frequently unsuitable for use in automated design. They may crash for large classes of input, be numerically unstable or locally non-smooth, or be highly sensitive to control parameters. To be useful, analysis programs must be modified to reduce or eliminate only the undesired behaviors, without altering the desired computation. To do this by direct modification of the programs is labor-intensive, and necessitates costly revalidation. We have implemented a high-level language and run-time environment that allow failure-handling strategies to be incorporated into existing Fortran and C analysis programs while preserving their computational integrity. Our approach relies on globally managing the execution of these programs at the level of discretely callable functions so that the computation is only affected when problems are detected. Problem handling procedures are constructed from a knowledge base of generic problem management strategies. We show that our approach is effective in improving analysis program robustness and design optimization performance in the domain of conceptual design of jet engine nozzles."
