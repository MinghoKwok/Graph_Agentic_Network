ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 681 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212923:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_1] "nan Abstract: Co-evolution of Pursuit and Evasion II: Simulation Methods and Results fl Abstract In a previous SAB paper [10], we presented the scient..."
3. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."

Text to classify:
"Guiding or Hiding: Explorations into the Effects of Learning on the Rate of Evolution.
Abstract: Individual lifetime learning can `guide' an evolving population to areas of high fitness in genotype space through an evolutionary phenomenon known as the Baldwin effect (Baldwin, 1896; Hin-ton & Nowlan, 1987). It is the accepted wisdom that this guiding speeds up the rate of evolution. By highlighting another interaction between learning and evolution, that will be termed the Hiding effect, it will be argued here that this depends on the measure of evolutionary speed one adopts. The Hiding effect shows that learning can reduce the selection pressure between individuals by `hiding' their genetic differences. There is thus a trade-off between the Baldwin effect and the Hiding effect to determine learning's influence on evolution and two factors that contribute to this trade-off, the cost of learning and landscape epis tasis, are investigated experimentally."
