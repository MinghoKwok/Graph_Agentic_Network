ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2661 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233259:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Minimax Risk over l p -Balls for l q -error Key Words. Minimax Decision Theory.
Abstract: Consider estimating the mean vector from data N n (; 2 I) with l q norm loss, q 1, when is known to lie in an n-dimensional l p ball, p 2 (0; 1). For large n, the ratio of minimax linear risk to minimax risk can be arbitrarily large if p &lt; q. Obvious exceptions aside, the limiting ratio equals 1 only if p = q = 2. Our arguments are mostly indirect, involving a reduction to a univariate Bayes minimax problem. When p &lt; q, simple non-linear co-ordinatewise threshold rules are asymptotically minimax at small signal-to-noise ratios, and within a bounded factor of asymptotic minimaxity in general. Our results are basic to a theory of estimation in Besov spaces"
