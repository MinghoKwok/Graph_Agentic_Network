ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2560 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232806:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning Default Concepts
Abstract: Classical concepts, based on necessary and sufficient defining conditions, cannot classify logically insufficient object descriptions. Many reasoning systems avoid this limitation by using "default concepts" to classify incompletely described objects. We address the task of learning such default concepts from observational data. We model the underlying performance task | classifying incomplete examples | by a probabilistic process where random test examples are passed through a "blocker" that can hide object attributes from the classifier. We then address the task of learning accurate default concepts from random training examples. We survey the learning techniques that have been proposed for this task in the machine learning and knowledge representation literatures, investigate the relative merits of each, and show that a superior learning technique can be developed from well known statistical principles. Finally, we extend Valiant's pac-learning framework to this context and obtain a number of useful learnability results."
