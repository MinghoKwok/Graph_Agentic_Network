ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1838 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225721:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes
Abstract: Given a set of samples of a probability distribution on a set of discrete random variables, we study the problem of constructing a good approximative neural network model of the underlying probability distribution. Our approach is based on an unsupervised learning scheme where the samples are first divided into separate clusters, and each cluster is then coded as a single vector. These Bayesian prototype vectors consist of conditional probabilities representing the attribute-value distribution inside the corresponding cluster. Using these prototype vectors, it is possible to model the underlying joint probability distribution as a simple Bayesian network (a tree), which can be realized as a feedforward neural network capable of probabilistic reasoning. In this framework, learning means choosing the size of the prototype set, partitioning the samples into the corresponding clusters, and constructing the cluster prototypes. We describe how the prototypes can be determined, given a partition of the samples, and present a method for evaluating the likelihood of the corresponding Bayesian tree. We also present a greedy heuristic for searching through the space of different partition schemes with different numbers of clusters, aiming at an optimal approximation of the probability distribution."
