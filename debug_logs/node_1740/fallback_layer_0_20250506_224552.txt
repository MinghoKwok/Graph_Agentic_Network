ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1740 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224552:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"As mentioned in the introduction, an encod-ing/crossover pair makes a spectrum of geographical linkages. A
Abstract: It is open as to which chromosomal dimension performs best. Although higher-dimensional encodings (whether real or imaginary) can preserve more geographical gene linkages, we suspect that too high a dimension would not perform desirably. We are studying the question of which dimension of encoding is best for a given instance. It is likely that the optimal dimension is somehow dependent on the chromosome size and the input graph topology; interactions with the flexibility of crossover are yet unknown. The interaction of these considerations with the number of cuts used in the crossover is also an open issue. * In relocating genes onto a multi-dimensional chromosome, the simplest way is via a sequential assignment such as row-major order. Section 4 showed that performance improves when a DFS-row-major reembedding is used for two- and three-dimensional encodings. We suspect that this phenomenon will be consistent for higher-dimensional cases, and hope to perform more detailed investigations in the future. Although DFS reordering proved to be helpful for both linear encodings [19] and multi-dimensional encodings, we do not believe DFS-row-major reembedding is a good approach for the multi-dimensional cases since the row-major embedding is so simplistic. We are considering alternative 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional reembeddings which will hopefully provide further improvement. [4] T. N. Bui and B. R. Moon.
