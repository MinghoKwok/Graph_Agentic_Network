ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 631 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215324:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 2 examples

"Extracting Provably Correct Rules from Artificial Neural Networks
Abstract: Although connectionist learning procedures have been applied successfully to a variety of real-world scenarios, artificial neural networks have often been criticized for exhibiting a low degree of comprehensibility. Mechanisms that automatically compile neural networks into symbolic rules offer a promising perspective to overcome this practical shortcoming of neural network representations. This paper describes an approach to neural network rule extraction based on Validity Interval Analysis (VI-Analysis). VI-Analysis is a generic tool for extracting symbolic knowledge from Backpropagation-style artificial neural networks. It does this by propagating whole intervals of activations through the network in both the forward and backward directions. In the context of rule extraction, these intervals are used to prove or disprove the correctness of conjectured rules. We describe techniques for generating and testing rule hypotheses, and demonstrate these using some simple classification tasks including the MONK's benchmark problems. Rules extracted by VI-Analysis are provably correct. No assumptions are made about the topology of the network at hand, as well as the procedure employed for training the network."
