ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2275 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232011:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 5 examples

"Connectionist Layered Object-Oriented Network Simulator (CLONES): User's Manual minimize the learning curve for using CLONES,
Abstract: CLONES is a object-oriented library for constructing, training and utilizing layered connectionist networks. The CLONES library contains all the object classes needed to write a simulator with a small amount of added source code (examples are included). The size of experimental ANN programs is greatly reduced by using an object-oriented library; at the same time these programs are easier to read, write and evolve. The library includes database, network behavior and training procedures that can be customized by the user. It is designed to run efficiently on data parallel computers (such as the RAP [6] and SPERT [1]) as well as uniprocessor workstations. While efficiency and portability to parallel computers are the primary goals, there are several secondary design goals: 3. allow heterogeneous algorithms and training procedures to be interconnected and trained together. Within these constraints we attempt to maximize the variety of artificial neural net work algorithms that can be supported."
