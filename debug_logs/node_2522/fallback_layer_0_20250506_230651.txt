ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2522 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230651:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."
3. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_2] "Word Perfect Corp. LIA: A Location-Independent Transformation for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2 Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a f..."
5. [Label_6] "Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve fi..."

Text to classify:
"A Symbolic Complexity Analysis of Connectionist Algorithms for Distributed-Memory Machines
Abstract: This paper attempts to rigorously determine the computation and communication requirements of connectionist algorithms running on a distributed-memory machine. The strategy involves (1) specifying key connectionist algorithms in a high-level object-oriented language, (2) extracting their running times as polynomials, and (3) analyzing these polynomials to determine the algorithms' space and time complexity. Results are presented for various implementations of the back-propagation algorithm [4]."
