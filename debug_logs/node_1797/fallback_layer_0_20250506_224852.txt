ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1797 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224852:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Improving the Performance of Evolutionary Optimization by Dynamically Scaling the Evaluation Function
Abstract: Traditional evolutionary optimization algorithms assume a static evaluation function, according to which solutions are evolved. Incremental evolution is an approach through which a dynamic evaluation function is scaled over time in order to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization. In this paper, we present empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for genetic programming. Using two domains, a two-agent pursuit-evasion game and the Tracker [6] trail-following task, we demonstrate that incremental evolution is most successful when applied near the beginning of an evolutionary run. We also show that incremental evolution can be successful when the intermediate evaluation functions are more difficult than the target evaluation function, as well as when they are easier than the target function."
