ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 670 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212847:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_5] "Relational Knowledge Discovery in Databases Abstract: In this paper, we indicate some possible applications of ILP or similar techniques in the knowle..."
3. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition via Knowledge Integration Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our a..."
4. [Label_6] "Pattern Theoretic Knowledge Discovery Abstract: Future research directions in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) include the ability to extract an..."
5. [Label_3] "Abstract Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the..."

"Rule Based Database Integration in HIPED Heterogeneous Intelligent Processing in Engineering Design
Abstract: In this paper 1 we describe one aspect of our research in the project called HIPED, which addressed the problem of performing design of engineering devices by accessing heterogeneous databases. The front end of the HIPED system consisted of interactive KRI-TIK, a multimodal reasoning system that combined case based and model based reasoning to solve a design problem. This paper focuses on the backend processing where five types of queries received from the front end are evaluated by mapping them appropriately using the "facts" about the schemas of the underlying databases and "rules" that establish the correspondance among the data in these databases in terms of relationships such as equivalence, overlap and set containment. The uniqueness of our approach stems from the fact that the mapping process is very forgiving in that the query received from the front end is evaluated with respect to a large number of possibilities. These possibilities are encoded in the form of rules that consider various ways in which the tokens in the given query may match relation names, attrribute names, or values in the underlying tables. The approach has been implemented using CORAL deductive database system as the rule processing engine."
