ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 874 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220615:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"LOCAL ADAPTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR BLIND SEPARATION OF NATURAL IMAGES
Abstract: In this paper a neural network approach for reconstruction of natural highly correlated images from linear (additive) mixture of them is proposed. A multi-layer architecture with local on-line learning rules is developed to solve the problem of blind separation of sources. The main motivation for using a multi-layer network instead of a single-layer one is to improve the performance and robustness of separation, while applying a very simple local learning rule, which is biologically plausible. Moreover such architecture with on-chip learning is relatively easy implementable using VLSI electronic circuits. Furthermore it enables the extraction of source signals sequentially one after the other, starting from the strongest signal and finishing with the weakest one. The experimental part focuses on separating highly correlated human faces from mixture of them, with additive noise and under unknown number of sources."
