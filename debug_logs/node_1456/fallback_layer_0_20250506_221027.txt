ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1456 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221027:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."
3. [Label_5] "Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms Abstract: We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logi..."
4. [Label_0] "AN INCREMENTAL LEARNING MODEL FOR COMMONSENSE REASONING Abstract:"
5. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."

Text to classify:
"An Interactive Model of Teaching
Abstract: Previous teaching models in the learning theory community have been batch models. That is, in these models the teacher has generated a single set of helpful examples to present to the learner. In this paper we present an interactive model in which the learner has the ability to ask queries as in the query learning model of Angluin [1]. We show that this model is at least as powerful as previous teaching models. We also show that anything learnable with queries, even by a randomized learner, is teachable in our model. In all previous teaching models, all classes shown to be teachable are known to be efficiently learnable. An important concept class that is not known to be learnable is DNF formulas. We demonstrate the power of our approach by providing a deterministic teacher and learner for the class of DNF formulas. The learner makes only equivalence queries and all hypotheses are also DNF formulas."
