ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1867 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225233:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A comparison of neural net and conventional techniques for lighting control
Abstract: We compare two techniques for lighting control in an actual room equipped with seven banks of lights and photoresistors to detect the lighting level at four sensing points. Each bank of lights can be independently set to one of sixteen intensity levels. The task is to determine the device intensity levels that achieve a particular configuration of sensor readings. One technique we explored uses a neural network to approximate the mapping between sensor readings and device intensity levels. The other technique we examined uses a conventional feedback control loop. The neural network approach appears superior both in that it does not require experimentation on the fly (and hence fluctuating light intensity levels during settling, and lengthy settling times) and in that it can deal with complex interactions that conventional control techniques do not handle well. This comparison was performed as part of the "Adaptive House" project, which is described briefly. Further directions for control in the"
