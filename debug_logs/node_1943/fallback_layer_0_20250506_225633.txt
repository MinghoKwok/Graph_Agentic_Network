ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1943 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225633:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Distributed Collective Adaptation Applied to a Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problem
Abstract: We utilize collective memory to integrate weak and strong search heuristics to find cliques in FC, a family of graphs. We construct FC such that pruning of partial solutions will be ineffective. Each weak heuristic maintains a local cache of the collective memory. We examine the impact on the distributed search from the various characteristics of the distribution of the collective memory, the search algorithms, and our family of graphs. We find the distributed search performs better than the individuals, even though the space of partial solutions is combinatorially explosive."
