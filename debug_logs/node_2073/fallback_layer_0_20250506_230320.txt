ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2073 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230320:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Classification Using -Machines and Constructive Function Approximation
Abstract: The classification algorithm CLEF combines a version of a linear machine known as a - machine with a non-linear function approxima-tor that constructs its own features. The algorithm finds non-linear decision boundaries by constructing features that are needed to learn the necessary discriminant functions. The CLEF algorithm is proven to separate all consistently labelled training instances, even when they are not linearly separable in the input variables. The algorithm is illustrated on a variety of tasks, showing an improvement over C4.5, a state-of-art de cision tree learning algorithm."
