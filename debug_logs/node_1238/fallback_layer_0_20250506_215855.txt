ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1238 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215855:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."
2. [Label_5] "Incremental Reduced Error Pruning Abstract: This paper outlines some problems that may occur with Reduced Error Pruning in relational learning algorit..."
3. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
4. [Label_6] "On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than sin..."
5. [Label_0] "A systematic description of greedy optimisation algorithms for cost sensitive generalisation Abstract: This paper defines a class of problems involvin..."

"On Pruning and Averaging Decision Trees
Abstract: Pruning a decision tree is considered by some researchers to be the most important part of tree building in noisy domains. While, there are many approaches to pruning, an alternative approach of averaging over decision trees has not received as much attention. We perform an empirical comparison of pruning with the approach of averaging over decision trees. For this comparison we use a computa-tionally efficient method of averaging, namely averaging over the extended fanned set of a tree. Since there are a wide range of approaches to pruning, we compare tree averaging with a traditional pruning approach, along with an optimal pruning approach."
