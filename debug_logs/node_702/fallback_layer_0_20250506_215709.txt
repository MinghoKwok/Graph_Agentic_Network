ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 702 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215709:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Automated Highway System
Abstract: ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Net) is a Backpropagation trained neural network which is capable of autonomously steering a vehicle in road and highway environments. Although ALVINN is fairly robust, one of the problems with it has been the time it takes to train. As the vehicle is capable of on-line learning, the driver has to drive the car for about 2 minutes before the network is capable of autonomous operation. One reason for this is the use of Backprop. In this report, we describe the original ALVINN system, and then look at three alternative training methods - Quickprop, Cascade Correlation, and Cascade 2. We then run a series of trials using Quickprop, Cascade Correlation and Cascade2, and compare them to a BackProp baseline. Finally, a hidden unit analysis is performed to determine what the network is learning. Applying Advanced Learning Algorithms to ALVINN"
