ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 600 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214553:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Separating hippocampal maps  Spatial Functions of the Hippocampal Formation and the
Abstract: The place fields of hippocampal cells in old animals sometimes change when an animal is removed from and then returned to an environment [ Barnes et al., 1997 ] . The ensemble correlation between two sequential visits to the same environment shows a strong bimodality for old animals (near 0, indicative of remapping, and greater than 0.7, indicative of a similar representation between experiences), but a strong unimodality for young animals (greater than 0.7, indicative of a similar representation between experiences). One explanation for this is the multi-map hypothesis in which multiple maps are encoded in the hippocampus: old animals may sometimes be returning to the wrong map. A theory proposed by Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997) suggests that the Barnes et al. experiment implies that the maps are pre-wired in the CA3 region of hippocampus. Here, we offer an alternative explanation in which orthogonalization properties in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of hippocampus interact with errors in self-localization (reset of the path integrator on re-entry into the environment) to produce the bimodality."
