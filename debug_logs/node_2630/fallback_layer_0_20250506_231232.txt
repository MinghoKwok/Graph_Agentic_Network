ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2630 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231232:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_3] "On the Markov Equivalence of Chain Graphs, Undirected Graphs, and Acyclic Digraphs Abstract: Graphical Markov models use undirected graphs (UDGs), acy..."
3. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
4. [Label_3] "Hidden Markov decision trees Abstract: We study a time series model that can be viewed as a decision tree with Markov temporal structure. The model is..."
5. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."

"Simulating Quadratic Dynamical Systems is PSPACE-complete (preliminary version)
Abstract: Quadratic Dynamical Systems (QDS), whose definition extends that of Markov chains, are used to model phenomena in a variety of fields like statistical physics and natural evolution. Such systems also play a role in genetic algorithms, a widely-used class of heuristics that are notoriously hard to analyze. Recently Rabinovich et al. took an important step in the study of QDS's by showing, under some technical assumptions, that such systems converge to a stationary distribution (similar theorems for Markov Chains are well-known). We show, however, that the following sampling problem for QDS's is PSPACE-hard: Given an initial distribution, produce a random sample from the t'th generation. The hardness result continues to hold for very restricted classes of QDS's with very simple initial distributions, thus suggesting that QDS's are intrinsically more complicated than Markov chains."
