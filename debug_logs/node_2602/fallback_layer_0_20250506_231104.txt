ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2602 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231104:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Method for Partial-Memory Incremental Learning and its Application to Computer Intrusion Detection Machine Learning
Abstract: This paper describes a partial-memory incremental learning method based on the AQ15c inductive learning system. The method maintains a representative set of past training examples that are used together with new examples to appropriately modify the currently held hypotheses. Incremental learning is evoked by feedback from the environment or from the user. Such a method is useful in applications involving intelligent agents acting in a changing environment, active vision, and dynamic knowledge-bases. For this study, the method is applied to the problem of computer intrusion detection in which symbolic profiles are learned for a computer systems users. In the experiments, the proposed method yielded significant gains in terms of learning time and memory requirements at the expense of slightly lower predictive accuracy and higher concept complexity, when compared to batch learning, in which all examples are given at once."
