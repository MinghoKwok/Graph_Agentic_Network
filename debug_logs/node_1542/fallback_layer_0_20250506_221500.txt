ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1542 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221500:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_2] "The megaprior heuristic for discovering protein sequence patterns Abstract: Several computer algorithms for discovering patterns in groups of protein ..."
2. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
3. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
4. [Label_2] "Homology Detection via Family Pairwise Search a straightforward generalization of pairwise sequence comparison algorithms to Abstract: The function of..."
5. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."

Text to classify:
"Protein Sequencing Experiment Planning Using Analogy protein sequencing experiments. Planning is interleaved with experiment execution,
Abstract: Experiment design and execution is a central activity in the natural sciences. The SeqER system provides a general architecture for the integration of automated planning techniques with a variety of domain knowledge in order to plan scientific experiments. These planning techniques include rule-based methods and, especially, the use of derivational analogy. Derivational analogy allows planning experience, captured as cases, to be reused. Analogy also allows the system to function in the absence of strong domain knowledge. Cases are efficiently and flexibly retrieved from a large casebase using massively parallel methods."
