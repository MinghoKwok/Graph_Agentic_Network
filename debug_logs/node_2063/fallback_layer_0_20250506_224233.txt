ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2063 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224233:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_3] "Hidden Markov decision trees Abstract: We study a time series model that can be viewed as a decision tree with Markov temporal structure. The model is..."

5. [Label_4] "Multi-Time Models for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Reinforcement learning can be used not only to predict rewards, but also to predict states, i.e..."

Text to classify:
"Planning Medical Therapy Using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes.
Abstract: Diagnosis of a disease and its treatment are not separate, one-shot activities. Instead they are very often dependent and interleaved over time, mostly due to uncertainty about the underlying disease, uncertainty associated with the response of a patient to the treatment and varying cost of different treatment and diagnostic (investigative) procedures. The framework particularly suitable for modeling such a complex therapy decision process is Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Unfortunately the problem of finding the optimal therapy within the standard POMDP framework is also computationally very costly. In this paper we investigate various structural extensions of the standard POMDP framework and approximation methods which allow us to simplify model construction process for larger therapy problems and to solve them faster. A therapy problem we target specifically is the management of patients with ischemic heart disease."
