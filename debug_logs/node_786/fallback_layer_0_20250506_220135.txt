ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 786 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220135:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning Boolean Read-Once Formulas over Generalized Bases
Abstract: A read-once formula is one in which each variable appears on at most a single input. Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski give a polynomial time algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to identify exactly read-once boolean formulas over the basis fAND; OR; NOTg [AHK93]. The goal of this work is to consider natural generalizations of these gates, in order to develop exact identification algorithms for more powerful classes of formulas. We show that read-once formulas over a basis of arbitrary boolean functions of constant fan-in k or less (i.e. any f : f0; 1g 1ck ! f0; 1g) are exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. We show that read-once formulas over the basis of arbitrary symmetric boolean functions are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time in this model. Given standard cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial time identification algorithm for read-twice formulas over either of these bases using membership and equivalence queries. We further show that for any basis class B meeting certain technical conditions, any polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over B can be extended to a polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over the union of B and the arbitrary functions of fan-in k or less. As a result, read-once formulas over the union of arbitrary symmetric and arbitrary constant fan-in gates are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries."
