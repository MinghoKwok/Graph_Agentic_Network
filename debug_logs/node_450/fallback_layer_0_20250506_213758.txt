ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 450 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213758:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Mapping Bayesian Networks to Boltzmann Machines
Abstract: We study the task of tnding a maximal a posteriori (MAP) instantiation of Bayesian network variables, given a partial value assignment as an initial constraint. This problem is known to be NP-hard, so we concentrate on a stochastic approximation algorithm, simulated annealing. This stochastic algorithm can be realized as a sequential process on the set of Bayesian network variables, where only one variable is allowed to change at a time. Consequently, the method can become impractically slow as the number of variables increases. We present a method for mapping a given Bayesian network to a massively parallel Bolztmann machine neural network architecture, in the sense that instead of using the normal sequential simulated annealing algorithm, we can use a massively parallel stochastic process on the Boltzmann machine architecture. The neural network updating process provably converges to a state which solves a given MAP task."
