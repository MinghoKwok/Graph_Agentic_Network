    "Improved Noise-Tolerant Learning and Generalized Statistical Queries
Abstract: The statistical query learning model can be viewed as a tool for creating (or demonstrating the existence of) noise-tolerant learning algorithms in the PAC model. The complexity of a statistical query algorithm, in conjunction with the complexity of simulating SQ algorithms in the PAC model with noise, determine the complexity of the noise-tolerant PAC algorithms produced. Although roughly optimal upper bounds have been shown for the complexity of statistical query learning, the corresponding noise-tolerant PAC algorithms are not optimal due to inefficient simulations. In this paper we provide both improved simulations and a new variant of the statistical query model in order to overcome these inefficiencies. We improve the time complexity of the classification noise simulation of statistical query algorithms. Our new simulation has a roughly optimal dependence on the noise rate. We also derive a simpler proof that statistical queries can be simulated in the presence of classification noise. This proof makes fewer assumptions on the queries themselves and therefore allows one to simulate more general types of queries. We also define a new variant of the statistical query model based on relative error, and we show that this variant is more natural and strictly more powerful than the standard additive error model. We demonstrate efficient PAC simulations for algorithms in this new model and give general upper bounds on both learning with relative error statistical queries and PAC simulation. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be simulated in the PAC model with malicious errors in such a way that the resultant PAC algorithm has a roughly optimal tolerable malicious error rate and sample complexity. Finally, we generalize the types of queries allowed in the statistical query model. We discuss the advantages of allowing these generalized queries and show that our results on improved simulations also hold for these queries.

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
