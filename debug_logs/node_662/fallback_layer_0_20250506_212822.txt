ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 662 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212822:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_6] "The Weighted Majority Algorithm Abstract: fl This research was primarily conducted while this author was at the University of Calif. at Santa Cruz wit..."
3. [Label_3] "Analysis of a Non-Reversible Markov Chain Sampler Abstract: Technical Report BU-1385-M, Biometrics Unit, Cornell University Abstract We analyse the co..."
4. [Label_3] "Maximum Likelihood and Covariant Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis somewhat more biologically plausible, involving no Abstract: Bell and S..."
5. [Label_5] "Modeling Superscalar Processors via Statistical Simulation Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"Free Energy Minimization Algorithm for Decoding and Cryptanalysis three binary vectors: s of length N
Abstract: where A is a binary matrix. Our task is to infer s given z and A, and given assumptions about the statistical properties of s and n. This problem arises in the decoding of a noisy signal transmitted using a linear code A, and in the inference of the sequence of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) from noisy observations [1, 2]."
