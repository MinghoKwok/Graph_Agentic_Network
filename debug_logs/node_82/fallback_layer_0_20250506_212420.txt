ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 82 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212420:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Job-shop Scheduling
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning methods to learn domain-specific heuristics for job shop scheduling. A repair-based scheduler starts with a critical-path schedule and incrementally repairs constraint violations with the goal of finding a short conflict-free schedule. The temporal difference algorithm T D() is applied to train a neural network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states. This evaluation function is used by a one-step looka-head search procedure to find good solutions to new scheduling problems. We evaluate this approach on synthetic problems and on problems from a NASA space shuttle payload processing task. The evaluation function is trained on problems involving a small number of jobs and then tested on larger problems. The TD sched-uler performs better than the best known existing algorithm for this task|Zweben's iterative repair method based on simulated annealing. The results suggest that reinforcement learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance scheduling systems."
