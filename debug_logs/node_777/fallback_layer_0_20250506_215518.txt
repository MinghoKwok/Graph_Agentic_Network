ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 777 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215518:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO SAMPLING FOR EVALUATING MULTIDIMENSIONAL INTEGRALS WITH APPLICATION TO BAYESIAN COMPUTATION
Abstract: Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods have become widely used for determining properties of a posterior distribution. Alternative to the Gibbs sampler, we elaborate on the Hit-and-Run sampler and its generalization, a black-box sampling scheme, to generate a time-reversible Markov chain from a posterior distribution. The proof of convergence and its applications to Bayesian computation with constrained parameter spaces are provided and comparisons with the other MCMC samplers are made. In addition, we propose an importance weighted marginal density estimation (IWMDE) method. An IWMDE is obtained by averaging many dependent observations of the ratio of the full joint posterior densities multiplied by a weighting conditional density w. The asymptotic properties for the IWMDE and the guidelines for choosing a weighting conditional density w are also considered. The generalized version of IWMDE for estimating marginal posterior densities when the full joint posterior density contains analytically intractable normalizing constants is developed. Furthermore, we develop Monte Carlo methods based on Kullback-Leibler divergences for comparing marginal posterior density estimators. This article is a summary of the author's Ph.D. thesis and it was presented in the Savage Award session."
