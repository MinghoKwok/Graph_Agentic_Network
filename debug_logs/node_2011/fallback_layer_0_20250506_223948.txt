ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2011 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223948:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
2. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."

Text to classify:
"An O(n log log n Learning Algorithm for DNF under the Uniform Distribution
Abstract: We show that a DNF with terms of size at most d can be approximated by a function with at most d O(d log1=") non zero Fourier coefficients such that the expected error squared, with respect to the uniform distribution, is at most ". This property is used to derive a learning algorithm for DNF, under the uniform distribution. The learning algorithm uses queries and learns, with respect to the uniform distribution, a DNF with terms of size at most d in time polynomial in n and d O(d log 1=") . The interesting implications are for the case when " is constant. In this case our algorithm learns a DNF with a polynomial number of terms in time n O(log log n) , and a DNF with terms of size at most O(log n= log log n) in polynomial time."
