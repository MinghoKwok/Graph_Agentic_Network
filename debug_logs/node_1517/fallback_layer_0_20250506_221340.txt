ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1517 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221340:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Robust Interpretation of Neural-Network Models
Abstract: Artificial Neural Network seem very promising for regression and classification, especially for large covariate spaces. These methods represent a non-linear function as a composition of low dimensional ridge functions and therefore appear to be less sensitive to the dimensionality of the covariate space. However, due to non uniqueness of a global minimum and the existence of (possibly) many local minima, the model revealed by the network is non stable. We introduce a method to interpret neural network results which uses novel robustification techniques. This results in a robust interpretation of the model employed by the network. Simulated data from known models is used to demonstrate the interpretability results and to demonstrate the effects of different regularization methods on the robustness of the model. Graphical methods are introduced to present the interpretation results. We further demonstrate how interaction between covariates can be revealed. From this study we conclude that the interpretation method works well, but that NN models may sometimes be misinterpreted, especially if the approximations to the true model are less robust."
