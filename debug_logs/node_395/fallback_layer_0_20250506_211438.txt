ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 395 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211438:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolving Graphs and Networks with Edge Encoding: Preliminary Report
Abstract: We present an alternative to the cellular encoding technique [Gruau 1992] for evolving graph and network structures via genetic programming. The new technique, called edge encoding, uses edge operators rather than the node operators of cellular encoding. While both cellular encoding and edge encoding can produce all possible graphs, the two encodings bias the genetic search process in different ways; each may therefore be most useful for a different set of problems. The problems for which these techniques may be used, and for which we think edge encoding may be particularly useful, include the evolution of recurrent neural networks, finite automata, and graph-based queries to symbolic knowledge bases. In this preliminary report we present a technical description of edge encoding and an initial comparison to cellular encoding. Experimental investigation of the relative merits of these encoding schemes is currently in progress."
