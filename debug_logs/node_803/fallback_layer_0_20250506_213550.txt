ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 803 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213550:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Optimal and Asymptotically Optimal Equi-partition of Rectangular Domains via Stripe Decomposition
Abstract: We present an efficient method for assigning any number of processors to tasks associated with the cells of a rectangular uniform grid. Load balancing equi-partition constraints are observed while approximately minimizing the total perimeter of the partition, which corresponds to the amount of interprocessor communication. This method is based upon decomposition of the grid into stripes of "optimal" height. We prove that under some mild assumptions, as the problem size grows large in all parameters, the error bound associated with this feasible solution approaches zero. We also present computational results from a high level parallel Genetic Algorithm that utilizes this method, and make comparisons with other methods. On a network of workstations, our algorithm solves within minutes instances of the problem that would require one billion binary variables in a Quadratic Assignment formulation."
