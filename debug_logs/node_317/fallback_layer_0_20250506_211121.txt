ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 317 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211121:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."
2. [Label_5] "Machine Learning and Inference Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches:..."
3. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
4. [Label_6] "On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than sin..."
5. [Label_0] "LINNEO A Classification Methodology for Ill-structured Domains Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover ..."

Text to classify:
"A dataset decomposition approach to data mining and machine discovery
Abstract: We present a novel data mining approach based on decomposition. In order to analyze a given dataset, the method decomposes it to a hierarchy of smaller and less complex datasets that can be analyzed independently. The method is experimentally evaluated on a real-world housing loans allocation dataset, showing that the decomposition can (1) discover meaningful intermediate concepts, (2) decompose a relatively complex dataset to datasets that are easy to analyze and comprehend, and (3) derive a classifier of high classification accuracy. We also show that human interaction has a positive effect on both the comprehensibility and classification accuracy."
