ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1116 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221306:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Abstract: Several authors have made a link between hidden Markov models for time series and energy-based models (Luttrell 1989, Williams 1990, Saul and Jordan 1995). Saul and Jordan (1995) discuss a linear Boltzmann chain model with state-state transition energies A ii 0 (going from state i to state i 0 ) and symbol emission energies B ij , under which the probability of an entire state fi l ; j l g L Whilst any HMM can be written as a linear Boltzmann chain by setting exp(A ii 0 ) = a ii 0 , exp(B ij ) = b ij and exp( i ) = i , not all linear Boltzmann chains can be represented as HMMs (Saul and Jordan 1995). However, the difference between the two models is minimal. To be precise, if the final hidden"
