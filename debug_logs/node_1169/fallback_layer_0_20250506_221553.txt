ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1169 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221553:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Individual and Collective Prognostic Prediction
Abstract: The prediction of survival time or recurrence time is an important learning problem in medical domains. The Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a natural, effective method for predicting recurrence times using censored input data. This paper introduces the Survival Curve RSA (SC-RSA), an extension to the RSA approach which produces accurate predicted rates of recurrence, while maintaining accuracy on individual predicted recurrence times. The method is applied to the problem of breast cancer recurrence using two different datasets."
