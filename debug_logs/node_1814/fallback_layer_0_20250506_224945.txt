ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1814 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224945:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Independent Component Analysis by General Non-linear Hebbian-like Learning Rules
Abstract: A number of neural learning rules have been recently proposed for Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The rules are usually derived from information-theoretic criteria such as maximum entropy or minimum mutual information. In this paper, we show that in fact, ICA can be performed by very simple Hebbian or anti-Hebbian learning rules, which may have only weak relations to such information-theoretical quantities. Rather suprisingly, practically any non-linear function can be used in the learning rule, provided only that the sign of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian term is chosen correctly. In addition to the Hebbian-like mechanism, the weight vector is here constrained to have unit norm, and the data is preprocessed by prewhitening, or sphering. These results imply that one can choose the non-linearity so as to optimize desired statistical or numerical criteria."
