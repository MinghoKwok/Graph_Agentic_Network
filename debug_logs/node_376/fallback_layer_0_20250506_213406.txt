ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 376 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213406:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Bayesian Finite Mixtures for Nonlinear Modeling of Educational data
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a Bayesian approach for finding latent classes in the data. In our approach we use finite mixture models to describe the underlying structure in the data, and demonstrate that the possibility to use full joint probability models raises interesting new prospects for exploratory data analysis. The concepts and methods discussed are illustrated with a case study using a data set from a recent educational study. The Bayesian classification approach described has been implemented, and presents an appealing addition to the standard toolbox for exploratory data analysis of educational data."
