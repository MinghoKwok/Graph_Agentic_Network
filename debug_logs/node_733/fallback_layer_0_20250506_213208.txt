ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 733 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213208:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolutionary Differentiation of Learning Abilities a case study on optimizing parameter values in Q-learning by
Abstract: This paper describes the first stage of our study on evolution of learning abilities. We use a simple maze exploration problem designed by R. Sut-ton as the task of each individual, and encode the inherent learning parameters on the genome. The learning architecture we use is a one step Q-learning using look-up table, where the inherent parameters are initial Q-values, learning rate, discount rate of rewards, and exploration rate. Under the fitness measure proportioning to the number of times it achieves at the goal in the later half of life, learners evolve through a genetic algorithm. The results of computer simulation indicated that learning ability emerge when the environment changes every generation, and that the inherent map for the optimal path can be acquired when the environment doesn't change. These results suggest that emergence of learning ability needs environmental change faster than alternate generation."
