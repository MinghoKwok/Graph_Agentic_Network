ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2080 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224326:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning..."
2. [Label_6] "Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive chara..."
3. [Label_5] "Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on Abstract: This paper tackles the supe..."
4. [Label_5] "The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for log..."
5. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."

Text to classify:
"Learning from positive data
Abstract: Gold showed in 1967 that not even regular grammars can be exactly identified from positive examples alone. Since it is known that children learn natural grammars almost exclusively from positives examples, Gold's result has been used as a theoretical support for Chomsky's theory of innate human linguistic abilities. In this paper new results are presented which show that within a Bayesian framework not only grammars, but also logic programs are learnable with arbitrarily low expected error from positive examples only. In addition, we show that the upper bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes' posterior probability when learning from positive examples is within a small additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and negative examples. An Inductive Logic Programming implementation is described which avoids the pitfalls of greedy search by global optimisation of this function during the local construction of individual clauses of the hypothesis. Results of testing this implementation on artificially-generated data-sets are reported. These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions."
