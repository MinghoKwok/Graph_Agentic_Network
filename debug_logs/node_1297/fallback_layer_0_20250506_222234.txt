ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1297 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222234:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The Origins of Inductive Logic Programming: A Prehistoric Tale
Abstract: This paper traces the development of the main ideas that have led to the present state of knowledge in Inductive Logic Programming. The story begins with research in psychology on the subject of human concept learning. Results from this research influenced early efforts in Artificial Intelligence which combined with the formal methods of inductive inference to evolve into the present discipline of Inductive Logic Programming. Inductive Logic Programming is often considered to be a young discipline. However, it has its roots in research dating back nearly 40 years. This paper traces the development of ideas beginning in psychology and the effect they had on concept learning research in Artificial Intelligence. Independent of any requirement for a psychological basis, formal methods of inductive inference were developed. These separate streams eventually gave rise to Inductive Logic Programming. This account is not entirely unbiased. More attention is given to the work of those researchers who most influenced my own interest in machine learning. Being a retrospective paper, I do not attempt to describe recent developments in ILP. This account only includes research prior to 1991 the year in which the term Inductive Logic Programming was first used (Muggleton, 1991). This is the reason for the subtitle A Prehistoric Tale. The major headings in the paper are taken from the names of periods in the evolution of life on Earth."
