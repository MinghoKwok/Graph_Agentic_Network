ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2004 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223926:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "PAC Learning Intersections of Halfspaces with Membership Queries (Extended Abstract) Abstract:"
2. [Label_5] "Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms Abstract: We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logi..."
3. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
4. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."
5. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"On Learning Bounded-Width Branching Programs
Abstract: In this paper, we study PAC-learning algorithms for specialized classes of deterministic finite automata (DFA). In particular, we study branching programs, and we investigate the influence of the width of the branching program on the difficulty of the learning problem. We first present a distribution-free algorithm for learning width-2 branching programs. We also give an algorithm for the proper learning of width-2 branching programs under uniform distribution on labeled samples. We then show that the existence of an efficient algorithm for learning width-3 branching programs would imply the existence of an efficient algorithm for learning DNF, which is not known to be the case. Finally, we show that the existence of an algorithm for learning width-3 branching programs would also yield an algorithm for learning a very restricted version of parity with noise."
