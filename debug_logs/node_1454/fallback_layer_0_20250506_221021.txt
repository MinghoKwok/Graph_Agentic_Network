ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1454 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221021:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."
2. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
3. [Label_2] "Application of Neural Networks for the Classification of Diffuse Liver Disease by Quantitative Echography Abstract: Three different methods were inves..."
4. [Label_2] "Fast Bounded Smooth Regression with Lazy Neural Trees Abstract: We propose the lazy neural tree (LNT) as the appropriate architecture for the realizat..."
5. [Label_3] "Discovering Structure in Continuous Variables Using Bayesian Networks Abstract: We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using nonlinear co..."

Text to classify:
"A Neural Network Model for Prognostic Prediction
Abstract: An important and difficult prediction task in many domains, particularly medical decision making, is that of prognosis. Prognosis presents a unique set of problems to a learning system when some of the outputs are unknown. This paper presents a new approach to prognostic prediction, using ideas from nonparametric statistics to fully utilize all of the available information in a neural architecture. The technique is applied to breast cancer prognosis, resulting in flexible, accurate models that may play a role in prevent ing unnecessary surgeries."
