ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 397 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211443:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Model of the Environment to Avoid Local Learning Abstract: Pier Luca Lanzi Technical Report N. 97.46 December 20 th , 1997"
2. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."
3. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
4. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
5. [Label_1] "Environmental Effects on Minimal Behaviors in the Minimat World Abstract: The structure of an environment affects the behaviors of the organisms that ..."

Text to classify:
"Truth-from-Trash Learning and the Mobot
Abstract: As natural resources become less abundant, we naturally become more interested in, and more adept at utilisation of waste materials. In doing this we are bringing to bear a ploy which is of key importance in learning | or so I argue in this paper. In the `Truth from Trash' model, learning is viewed as a process which uses environmental feedback to assemble fortuitous sensory predispositions (sensory `trash') into useful, information vehicles, i.e., `truthful' indicators of salient phenomena. The main aim will be to show how a computer implementation of the model has been used to enhance (through learning) the strategic abilities of a simulated, football playing mobot."
