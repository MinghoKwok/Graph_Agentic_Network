ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2527 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232629:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"248 Efficient Superscalar Performance Through Boosting
Abstract: The foremost goal of superscalar processor design is to increase performance through the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Previous studies have shown that speculative execution is required for high instruction per cycle (IPC) rates in non-numerical applications. The general trend has been toward supporting speculative execution in complicated, dynamically-scheduled processors. Performance, though, is more than just a high IPC rate; it also depends upon instruction count and cycle time. Boosting is an architectural technique that supports general speculative execution in simpler, statically-scheduled processors. Boosting labels speculative instructions with their control dependence information. This labelling eliminates control dependence constraints on instruction scheduling while still providing full dependence information to the hardware. We have incorporated boosting into a trace-based, global scheduling algorithm that exploits ILP without adversely affecting the instruction count of a program. We use this algorithm and estimates of the boosting hardware involved to evaluate how much speculative execution support is really necessary to achieve good performance. We find that a statically-scheduled superscalar processor using a minimal implementation of boosting can easily reach the performance of a much more complex dynamically-scheduled superscalar processor."
