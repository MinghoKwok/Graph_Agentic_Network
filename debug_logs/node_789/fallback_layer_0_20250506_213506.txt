ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 789 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213506:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
3. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
4. [Label_6] "A Statistical Approach to Solving the EBL Utility Problem Abstract: Many "learning from experience" systems use information extracted from problem sol..."
5. [Label_4] "Incremental Pruning: A Simple, Fast, Exact Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes Abstract: Most exact algorithms for general po..."

Text to classify:
"Stochastic Random or probabilistic but with some direction. For example the arrival of people at
Abstract: Simulated Annealing Search technique where a single trial solution is modified at random. An energy is defined which represents how good the solution is. The goal is to find the best solution by minimising the energy. Changes which lead to a lower energy are always accepted; an increase is probabilistically accepted. The probability is given by exp(E=k B T ). Where E is the change in energy, k B is a constant and T is the Temperature. Initially the temperature is high corresponding to a liquid or molten state where large changes are possible and it is progressively reduced using a cooling schedule so allowing smaller changes until the system solidifies at a low energy solution."
