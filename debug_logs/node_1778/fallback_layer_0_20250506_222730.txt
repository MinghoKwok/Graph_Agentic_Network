ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1778 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222730:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."
2. [Label_6] "Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Relevant Features Abstract: This paper describes efficient methods for exact and approximate implementation of th..."
3. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
4. [Label_0] "Context-Sensitive Feature Selection for Lazy Learners Abstract:"
5. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."

"SEMILINEAR PREDICTABILITY MINIMIZATION PRODUCES WELL-KNOWN FEATURE DETECTORS Neural Computation, 1996 (accepted)
Abstract: Predictability minimization (PM | Schmidhuber, 1992) exhibits various intuitive and theoretical advantages over many other methods for unsupervised redundancy reduction. So far, however, there were only toy applications of PM. In this paper, we apply semilinear PM to static real world images and find: without a teacher and without any significant preprocessing, the system automatically learns to generate distributed representations based on well-known feature detectors, such as orientation sensitive edge detectors and off-center-on-surround-like structures, thus extracting simple features related to those considered useful for image pre-processing and compression."
