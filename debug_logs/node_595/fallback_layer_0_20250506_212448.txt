ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 595 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212448:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"LEARNING TO CONTROL FAST-WEIGHT MEMORIES: AN ALTERNATIVE TO DYNAMIC RECURRENT NETWORKS (Neural Computation, 4(1):131-139, 1992)
Abstract: Previous algorithms for supervised sequence learning are based on dynamic recurrent networks. This paper describes an alternative class of gradient-based systems consisting of two feedforward nets that learn to deal with temporal sequences using fast weights: The first net learns to produce context dependent weight changes for the second net whose weights may vary very quickly. The method offers the potential for STM storage efficiency: A single weight (instead of a full-fledged unit) may be sufficient for storing temporal information. Various learning methods are derived. Two experiments with unknown time delays illustrate the approach. One experiment shows how the system can be used for adaptive temporary variable binding."
