ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 356 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211300:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_3] "BAYESIAN TIME SERIES: Models and Computations for the Analysis of Time Series in the Physical Sciences Abstract: This articles discusses developments ..."
3. [Label_1] "Environmental Effects on Minimal Behaviors in the Minimat World Abstract: The structure of an environment affects the behaviors of the organisms that ..."
4. [Label_3] "Analysis of a Non-Reversible Markov Chain Sampler Abstract: Technical Report BU-1385-M, Biometrics Unit, Cornell University Abstract We analyse the co..."

Text to classify:
"A Flexible Model For Human Circadian Rhythms
Abstract: Many hormones and other physiological processes vary in a circadian pattern. Although a sine/cosine function can be used to model these patterns, this functional form is not appropriate when there is asymmetry between the peak and nadir phases. In this paper we describe a semi-parametric periodic spline function that can be fit to circadian rhythms. The model includes both phase and amplitude so that the time and the magnitude of the peak or nadir can be estimated. We also describe tests of fit for components in the model. Data from an experiment to study immunological responses in humans are used to demonstrate the methods."
