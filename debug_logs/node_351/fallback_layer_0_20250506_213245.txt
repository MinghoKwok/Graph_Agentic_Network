ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 351 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213245:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Sequence Learning with Incremental Higher-Order Neural Networks
Abstract: An incremental, higher-order, non-recurrent neural-network combines two properties found to be useful for sequence learning in neural-networks: higher-order connections and the incremental introduction of new units. The incremental, higher-order neural-network adds higher orders when needed by adding new units that dynamically modify connection weights. The new units modify the weights at the next time-step with information from the previous step. Since a theoretically unlimited number of units can be added to the network, information from the arbitrarily distant past can be brought to bear on each prediction. Temporal tasks can thereby be learned without the use of feedback, in contrast to recurrent neural-networks. Because there are no recurrent connections, training is simple and fast. Experiments have demonstrated speedups of two orders of magnitude over recurrent networks."
