ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1781 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225421:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning Singly-Recursive Relations from Small Datasets
Abstract: The inductive logic programming system LOPSTER was created to demonstrate the advantage of basing induction on logical implication rather than -subsumption. LOPSTER's sub-unification procedures allow it to induce recursive relations using a minimum number of examples, whereas inductive logic programming algorithms based on -subsumption require many more examples to solve induction tasks. However, LOPSTER's input examples must be carefully chosen; they must be along the same inverse resolution path. We hypothesize that an extension of LOPSTER can efficiently induce recursive relations without this requirement. We introduce a generalization of LOPSTER named CRUSTACEAN that has this capability and empirically evaluate its ability to induce recursive relations."
