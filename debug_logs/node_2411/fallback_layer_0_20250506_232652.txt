ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2411 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232652:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Predictive Q-Routing: A Memory-based Reinforcement Learning Approach to Adaptive Traffic Control
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a memory-based Q-learning algorithm called predictive Q-routing (PQ-routing) for adaptive traffic control. We attempt to address two problems encountered in Q-routing (Boyan & Littman, 1994), namely, the inability to fine-tune routing policies under low network load and the inability to learn new optimal policies under decreasing load conditions. Unlike other memory-based reinforcement learning algorithms in which memory is used to keep past experiences to increase learning speed, PQ-routing keeps the best experiences learned and reuses them by predicting the traffic trend. The effectiveness of PQ-routing has been verified under various network topologies and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that PQ-routing is superior to"
