ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 982 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220605:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolutionary Neural Networks for Value Ordering in Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Abstract: Technical Report AI94-218 May 1994 Abstract A new method for developing good value-ordering strategies in constraint satisfaction search is presented. Using an evolutionary technique called SANE, in which individual neurons evolve to cooperate and form a neural network, problem-specific knowledge can be discovered that results in better value-ordering decisions than those based on problem-general heuristics. A neural network was evolved in a chronological backtrack search to decide the ordering of cars in a resource-limited assembly line. The network required 1/30 of the backtracks of random ordering and 1/3 of the backtracks of the maximization of future options heuristic. The SANE approach should extend well to other domains where heuristic information is either difficult to discover or problem-specific."
