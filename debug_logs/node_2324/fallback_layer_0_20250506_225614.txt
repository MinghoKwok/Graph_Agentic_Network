ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2324 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225614:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_6] "Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive chara..."
3. [Label_5] "Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms Abstract: We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logi..."
4. [Label_5] "Learning by Refining Algorithm Sketches Abstract: In this paper we suggest a mechanism that improves significantly the performance of a top-down induc..."

"APPLICATION OF ESOP MINIMIZATION IN MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
Abstract: This paper presents a new application of an Exclusive-Sum-Of-Products (ESOP) minimizer EXORCISM-MV-2: to Machine Learning, and particularly, in Pattern Theory. An analysis of various logic synthesis programs has been conducted at Wright Laboratory for machine learning applications. Creating a robust and efficient Boolean minimizer for machine learning that would minimize a decomposed function cardinality (DFC) measure of functions would help to solve practical problems in application areas that are of interest to the Pattern Theory Group especially those problems that require strongly unspecified multiple-valued-input functions with a large number of variables. For many functions, the complexity minimization of EXORCISM-MV-2 is better than that of Espresso. For small functions, they are worse than those of the Curtis-like Decomposer. However, EXORCISM is much faster, can run on problems with more variables, and significant DFC improvements have also been found. We analyze the cases when EXORCISM is worse than Espresso and propose new improvements for strongly unspecified functions."
