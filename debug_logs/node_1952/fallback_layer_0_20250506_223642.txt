ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1952 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223642:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Analysis of Decision Boundaries Generated by Constructive Neural Network Learning Algorithms
Abstract: Constructive learning algorithms offer an approach to incremental construction of near-minimal artificial neural networks for pattern classification. Examples of such algorithms include Tower, Pyramid, Upstart, and Tiling algorithms which construct multilayer networks of threshold logic units (or, multilayer perceptrons). These algorithms differ in terms of the topology of the networks that they construct which in turn biases the search for a decision boundary that correctly classifies the training set. This paper presents an analysis of such algorithms from a geometrical perspective. This analysis helps in a better characterization of the search bias employed by the different algorithms in relation to the geometrical distribution of examples in the training set. Simple experiments with non linearly separable training sets support the results of mathematical analysis of such algorithms. This suggests the possibility of designing more efficient constructive algorithms that dynamically choose among different biases to build near-minimal networks for pattern classification."
