ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 470 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214449:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"What Daimler-Benz has learned as an industrial partner from the Machine Learning Project StatLog
Abstract: Author of this paper was co-ordinator of the Machine Learning project StatLog during 1990-1993. This project was supported financially by the European Community. The main aim of StatLog was to evaluate different learning algorithms using real industrial and commercial applications. As an industrial partner and contributor, Daimler-Benz has introduced different applications to Stat-Log among them fault diagnosis, letter and digit recognition, credit-scoring and prediction of the number of registered trucks. We have learned a lot of lessons from this project which have effected our application oriented research in the field of Machine Learning (ML) in Daimler-Benz. We have distinguished that, especially, more research is necessary to prepare the ML-algorithms to handle the real industrial and commercial applications. In this paper we describe, shortly, the Daimler-Benz applications in StatLog, we discuss shortcomings of the applied ML-algorithms and finally we outline the fields where we think further research is necessary."
