ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 316 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213055:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Abstract: A Methodology for Evaluating Theory Revision Systems: Results Abstract Theory revision systems are learning systems that have a goal of making small changes to an original theory to account for new data. A measure for the distance between two theories is proposed. This measure corresponds to the minimum number of edit operations at the literal level required to transform one theory into another. By computing the distance between an original theory and a revised theory, the claim that a theory revision system makes few revisions to a theory may be quantitatively evaluated. We present data using both accuracy and the distance metric on Audrey II, with Audrey II fl"
