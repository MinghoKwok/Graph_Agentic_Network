ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2502 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232517:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Modeling Ill-Structured Optimization Tasks through Cases
Abstract: CABINS is a framework of modeling an optimization task in ill-structured domains. In such domains, neither systems nor human experts possess the exact model for guiding optimization. And the user's model of optimality is subjective and situation-dependent. CABINS optimizes a solution through iterative revision using case-based reasoning. In CABINS, task structure analysis was adopted for creating an initial model of the optimization task. Generic vocabularies found in the analysis were specialized into case feature descriptions for application problems. Extensive experimentation on job shop scheduling problems has shown that CABINS can operationalize and improve the model through the accumulation of cases."
