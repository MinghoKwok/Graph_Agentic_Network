ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1830 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225035:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Inductive CBR for Customer Support
Abstract: Over the past few years, the telecommunications paradigm has been shifting rapidly from hardware to middleware. In particular, the traditional issues of service characteristics and network control are being replaced by the modern, customer-driven issues of network and service management (e.g., electronic commerce, one-stop shops). An area of service management which has extremely high visibility and negative impact when managed badly is that of problem handling. Problem handling is a very knowledge intensive activity, particularly nowadays with the increase in number and complexity of services becoming available. Trials at several BT support centres have already demonstrated the potential of case-based reasoning technology in improving current practice for problem detection and diagnosis. A major cost involved in implementing a case-based system is in the manual building of the initial case base and then in the subsequent maintenance of that case base over time. This paper shows how inductive machine learning can be combined with case-based reasoning to produce an intelligent system capable of both extracting knowledge from raw data automatically and reasoning from that knowledge. In addition to discovering knowledge in existing data repositories, the integrated system may be used to acquire and revise knowledge continually. Experiments with the suggested integrated approach demonstrate promise and justify the next step."
