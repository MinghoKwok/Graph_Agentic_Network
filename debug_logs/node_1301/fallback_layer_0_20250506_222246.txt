ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1301 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222246:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Discovering Representation Space Transformations for Learning Concept Descriptions Combining DNF and M-of-N Rules
Abstract: This paper addresses a class of learning problems that require a construction of descriptions that combine both M-of-N rules and traditional Disjunctive Normal form (DNF) rules. The presented method learns such descriptions, which we call conditional M-of-N rules, using the hypothesis-driven constructive induction approach. In this approach, the representation space is modified according to patterns discovered in the iteratively generated hypotheses. The need for the M-of-N rules is detected by observing "exclusive-or" or "equivalence" patterns in the hypotheses. These patterns indicate symmetry relations among pairs of attributes. Symmetrical attributes are combined into maximal symmetry classes. For each symmetry class, the method constructs a "counting attribute" that adds a new dimension to the representation space. The search for hypothesis in iteratively modified representation spaces is done by the standard AQ inductive rule learning algorithm. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of solving problems that would be very difficult to tackle by any of the traditional symbolic learning methods."
