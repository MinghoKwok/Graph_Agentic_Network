ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2077 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224317:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "Testing the Robustness of the Genetic Algorithm on the Floating Building Block Representation. Abstract: Recent studies on a floating building block r..."
2. [Label_1] "A STUDY OF CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING Abstract: Holland's analysis of the sources of power of genetic algorithms has served as guidanc..."
3. [Label_1] "The Application of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to the n=m=P=C max Flowshop Problem Abstract: Hard combinatorial problems in sequencing and scheduling..."
4. [Label_1] "A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to..."
5. [Label_0] "A systematic description of greedy optimisation algorithms for cost sensitive generalisation Abstract: This paper defines a class of problems involvin..."

Text to classify:
"An Adaptive Penalty Approach for Constrained Genetic-Algorithm Optimization
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new adaptive penalty approach for handling constraints in genetic algorithm optimization problems. The idea is to start with a relatively small penalty coefficient and then increase it or decrease it on demand as the optimization progresses. Empirical results in several engineering design domains demonstrate the merit of the proposed approach."
