ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 231 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212628:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Understanding Creativity: A Case-Based Approach
Abstract: Dissatisfaction with existing standard case-based reasoning (CBR) systems has prompted us to investigate how we can make these systems more creative and, more broadly, what would it mean for them to be more creative. This paper discusses three research goals: understanding creative processes better, investigating the role of cases and CBR in creative problem solving, and understanding the framework that supports this more interesting kind of case-based reasoning. In addition, it discusses methodological issues in the study of creativity and, in particular, the use of CBR as a research paradigm for exploring creativity."
