ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2216 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231719:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Hybridized Crossover-Based Search Techniques for Program Discovery
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of program discovery as defined by Genetic Programming [10]. We have two major results: First, by combining a hierarchical crossover operator with two traditional single point search algorithms: Simulated Annealing and Stochastic Iterated Hill Climbing, we have solved some problems with fewer fitness evaluations and a greater probability of a success than Genetic Programming. Second, we have managed to enhance Genetic Programming by hybridizing it with the simple scheme of hill climbing from a few individuals, at a fixed interval of generations. The new hill climbing component has two options for generating candidate solutions: mutation or crossover. When it uses crossover, mates are either randomly created, randomly drawn from the population at large, or drawn from a pool of fittest individuals."
