ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1822 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225010:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Book Review New Kids on the Block way in the field of connectionist modeling. The
Abstract: Connectionist Models is a collection of forty papers representing a wide variety of research topics in connectionism. The book is distinguished by a single feature: the papers are almost exclusively contributions of graduate students active in the field. The students were selected by a rigorous review process and participated in a two week long summer school devoted to connectionism 2 . As the ambitious editors state in the foreword: These are bold claims and, if true, the reader is presented with an exciting opportunity to sample the frontiers of connectionism. Their words imply two ways to approach the book. The book must be read not just as a random collection of scientific papers, but also as a challenge to evaluate a controversial field. 2 This summer school is actually the third in a series, previous ones being held in 1986 and 1988. The proceedings of the 1988 summer school (which I had the priviledge of participating in) are reviewed by Nigel Goddard in [4]. Continuing the pattern, a fourth school is scheduled to be held in 1993 in Boulder, CO."
