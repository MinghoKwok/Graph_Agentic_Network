ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1039 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214821:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
2. [Label_1] "A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to..."
3. [Label_0] "The Role of Generic Models in Conceptual Change Abstract: 1 This research was funded in part by NSF Grant No. IRI-92-10925 and in part by ONR Grant No..."
4. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."
5. [Label_5] "The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for log..."

Text to classify:
"Functional Programming by Analogy
Abstract: In this paper we describe how the principles of problem solving by analogy can be applied to the domain of functional program synthesis. For this reason, we treat programs as syntactical structures. We discuss two different methods to handle these structures: (a) a graph metric for determining the distance between two program schemes, and (b) the Structure Mapping Engine (an existing system to examine analogical processing). Furthermore we show experimental results and discuss them."
