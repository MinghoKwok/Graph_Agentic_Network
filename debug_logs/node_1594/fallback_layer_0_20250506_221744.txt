ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1594 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221744:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"An Evolutionary Approach to Vector Quantizer Design
Abstract: Vector quantization is a lossy coding technique for encoding a set of vectors from different sources such as image and speech. The design of vector quantizers that yields the lowest distortion is one of the most challenging problems in the field of source coding. However, this problem is known to be difficult [3]. The conventional solution technique works through a process of iterative refinements which yield only locally optimal results. In this paper, we design and evaluate three versions of genetic algorithms for computing vector quantizers. Our preliminary study with Gaussian-Markov sources showed that the genetic approach outperforms the conventional technique in most cases."
