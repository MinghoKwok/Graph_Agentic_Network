ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1875 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225918:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_1: 2 examples
- Label_2: 3 examples
- Label_3: 1 examples
- Label_4: 1 examples
- Label_5: 1 examples
- Label_6: 3 examples

Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Theory of Correlations in Stochastic Neural Networks Abstract: One of the main experimental tools in probing the interactions between neurons has been..."
2. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_5] "Modeling Superscalar Processors via Statistical Simulation Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."

Text to classify:
"On the Effect of Analog Noise in Discrete-Time Analog Computations
Abstract: We introduce a model for analog computation with discrete time in the presence of analog noise that is flexible enough to cover the most important concrete cases, such as noisy analog neural nets and networks of spiking neurons. This model subsumes the classical model for digital computation in the presence of noise. We show that the presence of arbitrarily small amounts of analog noise reduces the power of analog computational models to that of finite automata, and we also prove a new type of upper bound for the"
