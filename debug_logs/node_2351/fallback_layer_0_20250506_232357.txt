ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2351 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232357:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"ERROR STABILITY PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED GRADIENT-TYPE ALGORITHMS
Abstract: We present a unified framework for convergence analysis of the generalized subgradient-type algorithms in the presence of perturbations. One of the principal novel features of our analysis is that perturbations need not tend to zero in the limit. It is established that the iterates of the algorithms are attracted, in a certain sense, to an "-stationary set of the problem, where " depends on the magnitude of perturbations. Characterization of those attraction sets is given in the general (nonsmooth and nonconvex) case. The results are further strengthened for convex, weakly sharp and strongly convex problems. Our analysis extends and unifies previously known results on convergence and stability properties of gradient and subgradient methods, including their incremental, parallel and "heavy ball" modifications. fl The first author is supported in part by CNPq grant 300734/95-6.
