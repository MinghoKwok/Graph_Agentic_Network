ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 782 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220122:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

- Label_0: 1 examples

"on Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems  Deriving Monotonic Function Envelopes from Observations
Abstract: Much work in qualitative physics involves constructing models of physical systems using functional descriptions such as "flow monotonically increases with pressure." Semiquantitative methods improve model precision by adding numerical envelopes to these monotonic functions. Ad hoc methods are normally used to determine these envelopes. This paper describes a systematic method for computing a bounding envelope of a multivariate monotonic function given a stream of data. The derived envelope is computed by determining a simultaneous confidence band for a special neural network which is guaranteed to produce only monotonic functions. By composing these envelopes, more complex systems can be simulated using semiquantitative methods."
