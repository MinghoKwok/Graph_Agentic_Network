ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1767 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224718:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Incremental Evolution of Complex General Behavior
Abstract: Several researchers have demonstrated how complex action sequences can be learned through neuro-evolution (i.e. evolving neural networks with genetic algorithms). However, complex general behavior such as evading predators or avoiding obstacles, which is not tied to specific environments, turns out to be very difficult to evolve. Often the system discovers mechanical strategies (such as moving back and forth) that help the agent cope, but are not very effective, do not appear believable and would not generalize to new environments. The problem is that a general strategy is too difficult for the evolution system to discover directly. This paper proposes an approach where such complex general behavior is learned incrementally, by starting with simpler behavior and gradually making the task more challenging and general. The task transitions are implemented through successive stages of delta-coding (i.e. evolving modifications), which allows even converged populations to adapt to the new task. The method is tested in the stochastic, dynamic task of prey capture, and compared with direct evolution. The incremental approach evolves more effective and more general behavior, and should also scale up to harder tasks."
