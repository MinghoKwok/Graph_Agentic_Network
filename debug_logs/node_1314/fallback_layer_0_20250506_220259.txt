ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1314 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220259:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Quick 'n' Dirty Generalization For Mobile Robot Learning Content Areas: robotics, reinforcement learning, machine learning,
Abstract: The mobile robot domain challenges policy-iteration reinforcement learning algorithms with difficult problems of structural credit assignment and uncertainty. Structural credit assignment is particularly acute in domains where "real-time" trial length is a limiting factor on the number of learning steps that physical hardware can perform. Noisy sensors and effectors in complex dynamic environments further complicate the learning problem, leading to situations where speed of learning and policy flexibility may be more important than policy optimality. Input generalization addresses these problems but is typically too time consuming for robot domains. We present two algorithms, YB-learning and YB , that perform simple and fast generalization of the input space based on bit-similarity. The algorithms trade off long-term optimality for immediate performance and flexibility. The algorithms were tested in simulation against non-generalized learning across different numbers of discounting steps, and YB was shown to perform better during the earlier stages of learning, particularly in the presence of noise. In trials performed on a sonar-based mobile robot subject to uncertainty of the "real world," YB surpassed the simulation results by a wide margin, strongly supporting the role of such "quick and dirty" generalization strategies in noisy real-time mobile robot domains."
