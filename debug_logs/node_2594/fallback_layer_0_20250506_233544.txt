ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2594 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233544:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Can Recurrent Neural Networks Learn Natural Language Grammars? W&Z recurrent neural networks are able to
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks are complex parametric dynamic systems that can exhibit a wide range of different behavior. We consider the task of grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks. Specifically, we consider the task of classifying natural language sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical can a recurrent neural network be made to exhibit the same kind of discriminatory power which is provided by the Principles and Parameters linguistic framework, or Government and Binding theory? We attempt to train a network, without the bifurcation into learned vs. innate components assumed by Chomsky, to produce the same judgments as native speakers on sharply grammatical/ungrammatical data. We consider how a recurrent neural network could possess linguistic capability, and investigate the properties of Elman, Narendra & Parthasarathy (N&P) and Williams & Zipser (W&Z) recurrent networks, and Frasconi-Gori-Soda (FGS) locally recurrent networks in this setting. We show that both"
