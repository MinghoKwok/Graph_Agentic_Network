ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 794 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213522:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_5] "Learning Trees and Rules with Set-valued Features Abstract: In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length "feature vectors", the c..."
2. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."
3. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."

Text to classify:
"Learning rules with local exceptions
Abstract: We present a learning algorithm for rule-based concept representations called ripple-down rule sets. Ripple-down rule sets allow us to deal with the exceptions for each rule separately by introducing exception rules, exception rules for each exception rule etc. up to a constant depth. These local exception rules are in contrast to decision lists, in which the exception rules must be placed into a global ordering of the rules. The localization of exceptions makes it possible to represent concepts that have no decision list representation. On the other hand, decision lists with a constant number of alternations between rules for different classes can be represented by constant depth ripple-down rule sets with only a polynomial increase in size. Our algorithm is an Occam algorithm for constant depth ripple-down rule sets and, hence, a PAC learning algorithm. It is based on repeatedly applying the greedy approximation method for the weighted set cover problem to find good exception rule sets."
