ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 901 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220152:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evaluating Computational Assistance for Crisis Response
Abstract: In this paper we examine the behavior of a human-computer system for crisis response. As one instance of crisis management, we describe the task of responding to spills and fires involving hazardous materials. We then describe INCA, an intelligent assistant for planning and scheduling in this domain, and its relation to human users. We focus on INCA's strategy of retrieving a case from a case library, seeding the initial schedule, and then helping the user adapt this seed. We also present three hypotheses about the behavior of this mixed-initiative system and some experiments designed to test them. The results suggest that our approach leads to faster response development than user-generated or automatically-generated schedules but without sacrificing solution quality."
