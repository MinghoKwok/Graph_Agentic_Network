ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 934 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220334:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Complexity Compression and Evolution
Abstract: Compression of information is an important concept in the theory of learning. We argue for the hypothesis that there is an inherent compression pressure towards short, elegant and general solutions in a genetic programming system and other variable length evolutionary algorithms. This pressure becomes visible if the size or complexity of solutions are measured without non-effective code segments called introns. The built in parsimony pressure effects complex fitness functions, crossover probability, generality, maximum depth or length of solutions, explicit parsimony, granularity of fitness function, initialization depth or length, and modulariz-ation. Some of these effects are positive and some are negative. In this work we provide a basis for an analysis of these effects and suggestions to overcome the negative implications in order to obtain the balance needed for successful evolution. An empirical investigation that supports our hypothesis is also presented."
