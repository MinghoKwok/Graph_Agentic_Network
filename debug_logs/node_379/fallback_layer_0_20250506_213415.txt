ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 379 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213415:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"In: Machine Learning, Meta-reasoning and Logics, pp207-232,  Learning from Imperfect Data
Abstract: Systems interacting with real-world data must address the issues raised by the possible presence of errors in the observations it makes. In this paper we first present a framework for discussing imperfect data and the resulting problems it may cause. We distinguish between two categories of errors in data random errors or `noise', and systematic errors and examine their relationship to the task of describing observations in a way which is also useful for helping in future problem-solving and learning tasks. Secondly we proceed to examine some of the techniques currently used in AI research for recognising such errors."
