ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2232 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231138:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Facing The Facts: Necessary Requirements For The Artificial Evolution of Complex Behaviour
Abstract: This paper sets out a conceptual framework for the open-ended artificial evolution of complex behaviour in autonomous agents. If recurrent dynamical neural networks (or similar) are used as phenotypes, then a Genetic Algorithm that employs variable length genotypes, such as Inman Harvey's SAGA, is capable of evolving arbitrary levels of be-havioural complexity. Furthermore, with simple restrictions on the encoding scheme that governs how genotypes develop into phenotypes, it may be guaranteed that if an increase in fitness requires an increase in be-havioural complexity, then it will evolve. In order for this process to be practicable as a design alternative, however, the time periods involved must be acceptable. The final part of this paper looks at general ways in which the encoding scheme may be modified to speed up the process. Experiments are reported in which different categories of scheme were tested against each other, and conclusions are offered as to the most promising type of encoding scheme for a vi able open-ended Evolutionary Robotics."
