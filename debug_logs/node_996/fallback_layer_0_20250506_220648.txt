ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 996 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220648:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Reparameterisation Issues in Mixture Modelling and their bearing on MCMC algorithms
Abstract: There is increasing need for efficient estimation of mixture distributions, especially following the explosion in the use of these as modelling tools in many applied fields. We propose in this paper a Bayesian noninformative approach for the estimation of normal mixtures which relies on a reparameterisation of the secondary components of the mixture in terms of divergence from the main component. As well as providing an intuitively appealing representation at the modelling stage, this reparameterisation has important bearing on both the prior distribution and the performance of MCMC algorithms. We compare two possible reparameterisations extending Mengersen and Robert (1996) and show that the reparameterisation which does not link the secondary components together is associated with poor convergence properties of MCMC algorithms."
