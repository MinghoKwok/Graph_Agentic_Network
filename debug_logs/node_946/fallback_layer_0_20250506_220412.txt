ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 946 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220412:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Constructive Learning of Recurrent Neural Networks: Limitations of Recurrent Casade Correlation and a Simple Solution
Abstract: It is often difficult to predict the optimal neural network size for a particular application. Constructive or destructive methods that add or subtract neurons, layers, connections, etc. might offer a solution to this problem. We prove that one method, Recurrent Cascade Correlation, due to its topology, has fundamental limitations in representation and thus in its learning capabilities. It cannot represent with monotone (i.e. sigmoid) and hard-threshold activation functions certain finite state automata. We give a "preliminary" approach on how to get around these limitations by devising a simple constructive training method that adds neurons during training while still preserving the powerful fully-recurrent structure. We illustrate this approach by simulations which learn many examples of regular grammars that the"
