ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1177 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221618:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"An Efficient Subsumption Algorithm for Inductive Logic Programming
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the efficiency of - subsumption (` ), the basic provability relation in ILP. As D ` C is NP-complete even if we restrict ourselves to linked Horn clauses and fix C to contain only a small constant number of literals, we investigate in several restrictions of D. We first adapt the notion of determinate clauses used in ILP and show that -subsumption is decidable in polynomial time if D is determinate with respect to C. Secondly, we adapt the notion of k-local Horn clauses and show that - subsumption is efficiently computable for some reasonably small k. We then show how these results can be combined, to give an efficient reasoning procedure for determinate k-local Horn clauses, an ILP-problem recently suggested to be polynomial predictable by Cohen (1993) by a simple counting argument. We finally outline how the -reduction algorithm, an essential part of every lgg ILP-learning algorithm, can be im proved by these ideas."
