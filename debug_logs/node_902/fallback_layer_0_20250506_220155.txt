ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 902 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220155:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Explanations of Empirically Derived Reactive Plans
Abstract: Given an adequate simulation model of the task environment and payoff function that measures the quality of partially successful plans, competition-based heuristics such as genetic algorithms can develop high performance reactive rules for interesting sequential decision tasks. We have previously described an implemented system, called SAMUEL, for learning reactive plans and have shown that the system can successfully learn rules for a laboratory scale tactical problem. In this paper, we describe a method for deriving explanations to justify the success of such empirically derived rule sets. The method consists of inferring plausible subgoals and then explaining how the reactive rules trigger a sequence of actions (i.e., a stra tegy) to satisfy the subgoals."
