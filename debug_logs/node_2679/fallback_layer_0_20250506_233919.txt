ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2679 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233919:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"STUDIES OF QUALITY MONITOR TIME SERIES: THE V.A. HOSPITAL SYSTEM build on foundational contributions in
Abstract: This report describes statistical research and development work on hospital quality monitor data sets from the nationwide VA hospital system. The project covers statistical analysis, exploration and modelling of data from several quality monitors, with the primary goals of: (a) understanding patterns of variability over time in hospital-level and monitor area specific quality monitor measures, and (b) understanding patterns of dependencies between sets of monitors. We present discussion of basic perspectives on data structure and preliminary data exploration for three monitors, followed by developments of several classes of formal models. We identify classes of hierarchical random effects time series models to be of relevance in mod-elling single or multiple monitor time series. We summarise basic model features and results of analyses of the three monitor data sets, in both single and multiple monitor frameworks, and present a variety of summary inferences in graphical displays. Our discussion includes summary conclusions related to the two key goals, discussions of questions of comparisons across hospitals, and some recommendations about further potential substantive and statistical investigations."
