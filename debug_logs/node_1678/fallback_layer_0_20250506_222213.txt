ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1678 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222213:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."
2. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
3. [Label_6] "On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than sin..."
4. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."
5. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."

Text to classify:
"Induction of One-Level Decision Trees
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress on the worst-case analysis of inductive learning tasks, but for theoretical results to have impact on practice, they must deal with the average case. In this paper we present an average-case analysis of a simple algorithm that induces one-level decision trees for concepts defined by a single relevant attribute. Given knowledge about the number of training instances, the number of irrelevant attributes, the amount of class and attribute noise, and the class and attribute distributions, we derive the expected classification accuracy over the entire instance space. We then examine the predictions of this analysis for different settings of these domain parameters, comparing them to exper imental results to check our reasoning."
