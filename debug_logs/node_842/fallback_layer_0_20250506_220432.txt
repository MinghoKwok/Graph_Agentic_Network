ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 842 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220432:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Metrics for Temporal Difference Learning
Abstract: For an absorbing Markov chain with a reinforcement on each transition, Bertsekas (1995a) gives a simple example where the function learned by TD( ll ) depends on ll . Bertsekas showed that for ll =1 the approximation is optimal with respect to a least-squares error of the value function, and that for ll =0 the approximation obtained by the TD method is poor with respect to the same metric. With respect to the error in the values, TD(1) approximates the function better than TD(0). However, with respect to the error in the differences in the values, TD(0) approximates the function better than TD(1). TD(1) is only better than TD(0) with respect to the former metric rather than the latter. In addition, direct TD( ll ) weights the errors unequally, while residual gradient methods (Baird, 1995, Harmon, Baird, & Klopf, 1995) weight the errors equally. For the case of control, a simple Markov decision process is presented for which direct TD(0) and residual gradient TD(0) both learn the optimal policy, while TD( 11 ) learns a suboptimal policy. These results suggest that, for this example, the differences in state values are more significant than the state values themselves, so TD(0) is preferable to TD(1)."
