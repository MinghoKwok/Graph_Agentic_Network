ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 524 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212101:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_5] "Machine Learning and Inference Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches:..."
3. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
4. [Label_2] "Application of Neural Networks for the Classification of Diffuse Liver Disease by Quantitative Echography Abstract: Three different methods were inves..."
5. [Label_5] "First Order Regression Abstract: We present a new approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), to handling numerical information in Inductive Logic ..."

Text to classify:
"An Inductive Learning Approach to Prognostic Prediction
Abstract: This paper introduces the Recurrence Surface Approximation, an inductive learning method based on linear programming that predicts recurrence times using censored training examples, that is, examples in which the available training output may be only a lower bound on the "right answer." This approach is augmented with a feature selection method that chooses an appropriate feature set within the context of the linear programming generalizer. Computational results in the field of breast cancer prognosis are shown. A straightforward translation of the prediction method to an artificial neural network model is also proposed."
