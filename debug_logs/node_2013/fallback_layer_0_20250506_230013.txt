ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2013 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230013:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Using the Stochastic Gradient Method to Fit Polychotomous Regression Models
Abstract: Technical Report No. 319 April 7, 1997 University of Washington Department of Statistics Seattle, Washington 98195-4322 Abstract Kooperberg, Bose, and Stone (1997) introduced polyclass, a methodology that uses adaptively selected linear splines and their tensor products to model conditional class probabilities. The authors attempted to develop a methodology that would work well on small and moderate size problems and would scale up to large problems. However, the version of polyclass that was developed for large problems was impractical in that it required two months of cpu time to apply it to a large data set. A modification to this methodology involving the use of the stochastic gradient (on-line) method in fitting polyclass models to given sets of basis functions is developed here that makes the methodology applicable to large data sets. In particular, it is successfully applied to a phoneme recognition problem involving 45 phonemes, 81 features, 150,000 cases in the training sample, 1000 basis functions, and 44,000 unknown parameters. Comparisons with neural networks are made both on the original problem and on a three-vowel subproblem."
