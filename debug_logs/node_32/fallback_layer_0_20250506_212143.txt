ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 32 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212143:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Design by Interactive Exploration Using Memory-Based Techniques
Abstract: One of the characteristics of design is that designers rely extensively on past experience in order to create new designs. Because of this, memory-based techniques from artificial intelligence, which help store, organise, retrieve, and reuse experiential knowledge held in memory, are good candidates for aiding designers. Another characteristic of design is the phenomenon of exploration in the early stages of design configuration. A designer begins with an ill-structured, partially defined, problem specification, and through a process of exploration gradually refines and modifies it as his/her understanding of the problem improves. In this paper we describe demex, an interactive computer-aided design system that employs memory-based techniques to help its users explore the design problems they pose to the system, in order to acquire a better understanding of the requirements of the problems. demex has been applied in the domain of structural design of buildings."
