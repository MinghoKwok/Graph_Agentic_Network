ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1946 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225643:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Plateaus and Plateau Search in Boolean Satisfiability Problems: When to Give Up Searching and Start Again
Abstract: We empirically investigate the properties of the search space and the behavior of hill-climbing search for solving hard, random Boolean satisfiability problems. In these experiments it was frequently observed that rather than attempting to escape from plateaus by extensive search, it was better to completely restart from a new random initial state. The optimum point to terminate search and restart was determined empirically over a range of problem sizes and complexities. The growth rate of the optimum cutoff is faster than linear with the number of features, although the exact growth rate was not determined. Based on these empirical results, a simple run-time heuristic is proposed to determine when to give up searching a plateau and restart. This heuristic closely approximates the empirically determined optimum values over a range of problem sizes and complexities, and consequently allows the search algorithm to automatically adjust its strategy for each particular problem without prior knowledge of the problem's complexity."
