ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 525 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212104:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_3] "SINGLE FACTOR ANALYSIS BY MML ESTIMATION Abstract: The Minimum Message Length (MML) technique is applied to the problem of estimating the parameters o..."
2. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."
3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_3] "On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary Abstract: New methodology for fully Bayesian mixture analysis is develo..."
5. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."

Text to classify:
"MML mixture modelling of multi-state, Poisson, von Mises circular and Gaussian distributions
Abstract: Minimum Message Length (MML) is an invariant Bayesian point estimation technique which is also consistent and efficient. We provide a brief overview of MML inductive inference (Wallace and Boulton (1968), Wallace and Freeman (1987)), and how it has both an information-theoretic and a Bayesian interpretation. We then outline how MML is used for statistical parameter estimation, and how the MML mixture mod-elling program, Snob (Wallace and Boulton (1968), Wal-lace (1986), Wallace and Dowe(1994)) uses the message lengths from various parameter estimates to enable it to combine parameter estimation with selection of the number of components. The message length is (to within a constant) the logarithm of the posterior probability of the theory. So, the MML theory can also be regarded as the theory with the highest posterior probability. Snob currently assumes that variables are uncorrelated, and permits multi-variate data from Gaussian, discrete multi-state, Poisson and von Mises circular distributions."
