ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 496 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211933:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"BRAINSTRUCTURED CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS THAT PERCEIVE AND LEARN
Abstract: This paper specifies the main features of Brain-like, Neuronal, and Connectionist models; argues for the need for, and usefulness of, appropriate successively larger brain-like structures; and examines parallel-hierarchical Recognition Cone models of perception from this perspective, as examples of such structures. The anatomy, physiology, behavior, and development of the visual system are briefly summarized to motivate the architecture of brain-structured networks for perceptual recognition. Results are presented from simulations of carefully pre-designed Recognition Cone structures that perceive objects (e.g., houses) in digitized photographs. A framework for perceptual learning is introduced, including mechanisms for generation-discovery (feedback-guided growth of new links and nodes, subject to brain-like constraints (e.g., local receptive fields, global convergence-divergence). The information processing transforms discovered through generation are fine-tuned by feedback-guided reweight-ing of links. Some preliminary results are presented of brain-structured networks that learn to recognize simple objects (e.g., letters of the alphabet, cups, apples, bananas) through feedback-guided generation and reweighting. These show large improvements over networks that either lack brain-like structure or/and learn by reweighting of links alone."
