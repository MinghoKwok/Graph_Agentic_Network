ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 679 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215556:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Developing Case-Based Reasoning for Structural Design
Abstract: The use of case-based reasoning as a process model of design involves the subtasks of recalling previously known designs from memory and adapting these design cases or subcases to fit the current design context. The development of this process model for a particular design domain proceeds in parallel with the development of a representation for the cases, the case memory organisation, and the design knowledge needed in addition to specific designs. The selection of a particular representational paradigm for these types of information, and the details of its use for a particular problemsolving domain, depend on the intended use of the information to be represented and the project information available, as well as the nature of the domain. In this paper we describe the development and implementation of four case-based design systems: CASECAD, CADSYN, WIN, and DEMEX. Each system is described in terms of the content, organisation, and source of case memory, and the implementation of case recall and case adaptation. A comparison of these systems considers the relative advantages and disadvantages of the implementations."
