ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1133 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215323:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Fast Non-Parametric Density Estimation Algorithm
Abstract: Non-parametric density estimation is the problem of approximating the values of a probability density function, given samples from the associated distribution. Non-parametric estimation finds applications in discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and flow calculations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Usual estimators make use of kernel functions, and require on the order of n 2 arithmetic operations to evaluate the density at n sample points. We describe a sequence of special weight functions which requires almost linear number of operations in n for the same computation."
