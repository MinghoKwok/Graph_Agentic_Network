ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2590 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231026:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Fast Bounded Smooth Regression with Lazy Neural Trees Abstract: We propose the lazy neural tree (LNT) as the appropriate architecture for the realizat..."
2. [Label_3] "BAYESIAN TIME SERIES: Models and Computations for the Analysis of Time Series in the Physical Sciences Abstract: This articles discusses developments ..."
3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_3] "Maximum Likelihood and Covariant Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis somewhat more biologically plausible, involving no Abstract: Bell and S..."
5. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."

Text to classify:
"Backfitting in Smoothing Spline ANOVA
Abstract: A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near) tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described."
