ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1665 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224809:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning
Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that applies conceptual clustering and concept representations to facilitate the efficient use of past experiences (cases) during analogical reasoning (Borner 1995). The approach was developed and implemented in SYN* (see also (Borner 1994, Borner and Faauer 1995)) to support the design of supply nets in building engineering. This paper sketches the task; it outlines the nearest-neighbor-based agglomerative conceptual clustering applied in organizing large amounts of structured cases into case classes; it provides the concept representation used to characterize case classes and shows the analogous solution of new problems based on the concepts available. However, the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate CA in terms of its reasoning efficiency; its capability to derive solutions that go beyond the cases in the case base but still preserve the quality of cases."
