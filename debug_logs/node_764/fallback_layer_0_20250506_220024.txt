ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 764 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220024:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"GENETIC AND NON GENETIC OPERATORS IN ALECSYS
Abstract: It is well known that standard learning classifier systems, when applied to many different domains, exhibit a number of problems: payoff oscillation, difficult to regulate interplay between the reward system and the background genetic algorithm (GA), rule chains instability, default hierarchies instability, are only a few. ALECSYS is a parallel version of a standard learning classifier system (CS), and as such suffers of these same problems. In this paper we propose some innovative solutions to some of these problems. We introduce the following original features. Mutespec, a new genetic operator used to specialize potentially useful classifiers. Energy, a quantity introduced to measure global convergence in order to apply the genetic algorithm only when the system is close to a steady state. Dynamical adjustment of the classifiers set cardinality, in order to speed up the performance phase of the algorithm. We present simulation results of experiments run in a simulated two-dimensional world in which a simple agent learns to follow a light source."
