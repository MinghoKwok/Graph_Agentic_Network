ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1654 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222055:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_3] "On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary Abstract: New methodology for fully Bayesian mixture analysis is develo..."
2. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."
3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."
5. [Label_2] "The megaprior heuristic for discovering protein sequence patterns Abstract: Several computer algorithms for discovering patterns in groups of protein ..."

Text to classify:
"Hyperparameter estimation in Dirichlet process mixture models
Abstract: In Bayesian density estimation and prediction using Dirichlet process mixtures of standard, exponential family distributions, the precision or total mass parameter of the mixing Dirichlet process is a critical hyperparame-ter that strongly influences resulting inferences about numbers of mixture components. This note shows how, with respect to a flexible class of prior distributions for this parameter, the posterior may be represented in a simple conditional form that is easily simulated. As a result, inference about this key quantity may be developed in tandem with the existing, routine Gibbs sampling algorithms for fitting such mixture models. The concept of data augmentation is important, as ever, in developing this extension of the existing algorithm. A final section notes an simple asymptotic approx imation to the posterior."
