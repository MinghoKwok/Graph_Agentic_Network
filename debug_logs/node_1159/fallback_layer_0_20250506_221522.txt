ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1159 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221522:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"An evolutionary tabu search algorithm and the NHL scheduling problem
Abstract: We present in this paper a new evolutionary procedure for solving general optimization problems that combines efficiently the mechanisms of genetic algorithms and tabu search. In order to explore the solution space properly interaction phases are interspersed with periods of optimization in the algorithm. An adaptation of this search principle to the National Hockey League (NHL) problem is discussed. The hybrid method developed in this paper is well suited for Open Shop Scheduling problems (OSSP). The results obtained appear to be quite satisfactory."
