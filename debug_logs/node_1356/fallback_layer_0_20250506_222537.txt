ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1356 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222537:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Constraint Tangent Distance for On-line Character Recognition
Abstract: In on-line character recognition we can observe two kinds of intra-class variations: small geometric deformations and completely different writing styles. We propose a new approach to deal with these problems by defining an extension of tangent distance [9], well known in off-line character recognition. The system has been implemented with a k-nearest neighbor classifier and a so called diabolo classifier [6] respectively. Both classifiers are invariant under transformations like rotation, scale or slope and can deal with variations in stroke order and writing direction. Results are presented for our digit database with more than 200 writers."
