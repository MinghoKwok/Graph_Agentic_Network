ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Action Prompt for Node 1775 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225402:

    You are Node 1775 in a scientific citation network. Your task is to classify yourself into the correct research category based on your text and connections.
    
    ## Few-shot Examples of Label Prediction:

    Example 1:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "A novel deep learning approach for image classification..."
    2. [Reinforcement_Learning] "Q-learning based algorithm for game playing..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Deep learning models for visual recognition tasks..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: The current text focuses on deep learning and visual recognition, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    Example 2:
    Memory:
    1. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Bayesian networks for uncertainty modeling..."
    2. [Neural_Networks] "Recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction..."
    3. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Markov models for time series analysis..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Hidden Markov models for speech recognition..."

    Prediction: Probabilistic_Methods
    Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models, which is a probabilistic method, matching the Probabilistic_Methods examples in memory.

    Example 3:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "Deep learning architectures for natural language processing..."
    2. [Theory] "Theoretical analysis of algorithm complexity..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Transformer models for sequence modeling..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Attention mechanisms in deep learning models for text understanding..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.
    
    ## Your State:
    - Node ID: 1775
    - Layer: 0
    - Your Text:
    "GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND VERY FAST SIMULATED REANNEALING: A COMPARISON
Abstract: We compare Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a functional search method, Very Fast Simulated Reannealing (VFSR), that not only is efficient in its search strategy, but also is statistically guaranteed to find the function optima. GA previously has been demonstrated to be competitive with other standard Boltzmann-type simulated annealing techniques. Presenting a suite of six standard test functions to GA and VFSR codes from previous studies, without any additional fine tuning, strongly suggests that VFSR can be expected to be orders of magnitude more efficient than GA."
    - Neighbors: [163, 1728, 1771, 1793, 1795, 2082, 2116]
    - Available labeled neighbors to retrieve from: None
    - Neighbors with predicted labels: None
    
    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
