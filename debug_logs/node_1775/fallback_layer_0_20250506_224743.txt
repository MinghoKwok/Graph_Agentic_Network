ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1775 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224743:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND VERY FAST SIMULATED REANNEALING: A COMPARISON
Abstract: We compare Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a functional search method, Very Fast Simulated Reannealing (VFSR), that not only is efficient in its search strategy, but also is statistically guaranteed to find the function optima. GA previously has been demonstrated to be competitive with other standard Boltzmann-type simulated annealing techniques. Presenting a suite of six standard test functions to GA and VFSR codes from previous studies, without any additional fine tuning, strongly suggests that VFSR can be expected to be orders of magnitude more efficient than GA."
