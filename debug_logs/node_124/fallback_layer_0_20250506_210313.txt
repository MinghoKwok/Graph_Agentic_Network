ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 124 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210313:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Self-Organization and Segmentation in a Laterally Connected Orientation Map of Spiking Neurons
Abstract: The RF-SLISSOM model integrates two separate lines of research on computational modeling of the visual cortex. Laterally connected self-organizing maps have been used to model how afferent structures such as orientation columns and patterned lateral connections can simultaneously self-organize through input-driven Hebbian adaptation. Spiking neurons with leaky integrator synapses have been used to model image segmentation and binding by synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal group activity. Although these approaches differ in how they model the neuron and what they explain, they share the same overall layout of a laterally connected two-dimensional network. This paper shows how both self-organization and segmentation can be achieved in such an integrated network, thus presenting a unified model of development and functional dynamics in the primary visual cortex."
