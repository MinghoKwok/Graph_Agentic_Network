ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2048 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224146:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition via Knowledge Integration Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our a..."
5. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."

Text to classify:
"Technical Diagnosis: Fallexperte-D of further knowledge sources (domain knowledge, common knowledge) is investigated in the
Abstract: Case based reasoning (CBR) uses the knowledge from former experiences ("known cases"). Since special knowledge of an expert is mainly subject to his experiences, the CBR techniques are a good base for the development of expert systems. We investigate the problem for technical diagnosis. Diagnosis is not considered as a classification task, but as a process to be guided by computer assisted experience. This corresponds to the flexible "case completion" approach. Flexibility is also needed for the expert view with predominant interest in the unexpected, unpredictible cases."
