ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 810 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213612:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"MIXED MEMORY MARKOV MODELS FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Abstract: This paper presents a method for analyzing coupled time series using Markov models in a domain where the state space is immense. To make the parameter estimation tractable, the large state space is represented as the Cartesian product of smaller state spaces, a paradigm known as factorial Markov models. The transition matrix for this model is represented as a mixture of the transition matrices of the underlying dynamical processes. This formulation is know as mixed memory Markov models. Using this framework, we analyze the daily exchange rates for five currencies - British pound, Canadian dollar, Deutsch mark, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc as measured against the U.S. dollar."
