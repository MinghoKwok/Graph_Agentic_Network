ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2198 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230952:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"An Incremental Interactive Algorithm for Regular Grammar Inference
Abstract: We present provably correct interactive algorithms for learning regular grammars from positive examples and membership queries. A structurally complete set of strings from a language L(G) corresponding to a target regular grammar G implicitly specifies a lattice of finite state automata (FSA) which contains a FSA M G corresponding to G. The lattice is compactly represented as a version-space and M G is identified by searching the version-space using membership queries. We explore the problem of regular grammar inference in a setting where positive examples are provided intermittently. We provide an incremental version of the algorithm along with a set of sufficient conditions for its convergence."
