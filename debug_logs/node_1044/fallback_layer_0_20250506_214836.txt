ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1044 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214836:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Word Perfect Corp. LIA: A Location-Independent Transformation for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2
Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a fixed topology during learning, and often suffer from a number of shortcomings as a result. ANNs that use dynamic topologies have shown ability to overcome many of these problems. Adaptive Self Organizing Concurrent Systems (ASOCS) are a class of learning models with inherently dynamic topologies. This paper introduces Location-Independent Transformations (LITs) as a general strategy for implementing learning models that use dynamic topologies efficiently in parallel hardware. A LIT creates a set of location-independent nodes, where each node computes its part of the network output independent of other nodes, using local information. This type of transformation allows efficient support for adding and deleting nodes dynamically during learning. In particular, this paper presents the Location - Independent ASOCS (LIA) model as a LIT for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2. The description of LIA gives formal definitions for LIA algorithms. Because LIA implements basic ASOCS mechanisms, these definitions provide a formal description of basic ASOCS mechanisms in general, in addition to LIA."
