ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2125 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231235:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"On the Usage of Differential Evolution for Function Optimization Differential Evolution (DE) has recently proven
Abstract: assumed unless otherwise stated. Basically, DE generates new parameter vectors by adding the weighted difference between two population vectors to a third vector. If the resulting vector yields a lower objective function value than a predetermined population member, the newly generated vector replaces the vector, with which it was compared, in the next generation; otherwise, the old vector is retained. This basic principle, however, is extended when it comes to the practical variants of DE. For example an existing vector can be perturbed by adding more than one weighted difference vector to it. In most cases, it is also worthwhile to mix the parameters of the old vector with those of the perturbed one before comparing the objective function values. Several variants of DE which have proven to be useful will be described in the"
