ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 458 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211740:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
3. [Label_2] "Shattering all sets of k points in "general position" requires (k 1)=2 parameters Abstract: For classes of concepts defined by certain classes of anal..."
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_2] "Modeling Cortical Plasticity Based on Adapting Lateral Interaction Abstract: A neural network model called LISSOM for the cooperative self-organizatio..."

Text to classify:
"Quantifying neighbourhood preservation in topographic mappings
Abstract: Mappings that preserve neighbourhood relationships are important in many contexts, from neurobiology to multivariate data analysis. It is important to be clear about precisely what is meant by preserving neighbourhoods. At least three issues have to be addressed: how neighbourhoods are defined, how a perfectly neighbourhood preserving mapping is defined, and how an objective function for measuring discrepancies from perfect neighbour-hood preservation is defined. We review several standard methods, and using a simple example mapping problem show that the different assumptions of each lead to non-trivially different answers. We also introduce a particular measure for topographic distortion, which has the form of a quadratic assignment problem. Many previous methods are closely related to this measure, which thus serves to unify disparate approaches."
