ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 969 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214441:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning Stochastic Feedforward Networks
Abstract: Connectionist learning procedures are presented for "sigmoid" and "noisy-OR" varieties of stochastic feedforward network. These networks are in the same class as the "belief networks" used in expert systems. They represent a probability distribution over a set of visible variables using hidden variables to express correlations. Conditional probability distributions can be exhibited by stochastic simulation for use in tasks such as classification. Learning from empirical data is done via a gradient-ascent method analogous to that used in Boltzmann machines, but due to the feedforward nature of the connections, the negative phase of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid feedforward network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge."
