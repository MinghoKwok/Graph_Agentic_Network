ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2552 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232742:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Inferring sparse, overcomplete image codes using an efficient coding framework
Abstract: We apply a general technique for learning overcomplete bases to the problem of finding efficient image codes. The bases learned by the algorithm are localized, oriented, and bandpass, consistent with earlier results obtained using related methods. We show that the learned bases are Gabor-like in structure and that higher degrees of overcompleteness produce greater sampling density in position, orientation, and scale. The efficient coding framework provides a method for comparing different bases objectively by calculating their probability given the observed data or by measuring the entropy of the basis function coefficients. Compared to complete and overcomplete Fourier and wavelet bases, the learned bases have much better coding efficiency. We demonstrate the improvement in the representation of the learned bases by showing superior performance in image denoising and filling-in of missing pixels."
