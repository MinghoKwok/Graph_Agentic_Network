ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2325 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232241:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Incremental Polynomial Model-Controller Network: a self organising non-linear controller
Abstract: The aim of this study is to present the "Incremental Polynomial Model-Controller Network" (IPMCN). This network is composed of controllers each one attached to a model used for its indirect design. At each instant the controller connected to the model performing the best is selected. An automatic network construction algorithm is discribed in this study. It makes the IPMCN a self-organising non-linear controller. However the emphasis is on the polynomial controllers that are the building blocks of the IPMCN. From an analysis of the properties of polynomial functions for system modelling it is shown that multiple low order odd polynomials are very suitable to model non-linear systems. A closed loop reference model method to design a controller from a odd polynomial model is then described. The properties of the IPMCN are illustrated according to a second order system having both system states y and _y involving non-linear behaviour. It shows that as a component of a network or alone, a low order odd polynomial controller performs much better than a linear adaptive controller. Moreover, the number of controllers is significantly reduced with the increase of the polynomial order of the controllers and an improvement of the control performance is proportional to the decrease of the number of controllers. In addition, the clustering free approach, applied for the selection of the controllers, makes the IPMCN insensitive to the number of quantities involving nonlinearity in the system. The use of local controllers capable of handling systems with complex dynamics will make this scheme one of the most effective approaches for the control of non-linear systems."
