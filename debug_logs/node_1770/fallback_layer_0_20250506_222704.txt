ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1770 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222704:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."
3. [Label_2] "Separating hippocampal maps  Spatial Functions of the Hippocampal Formation and the Abstract: The place fields of hippocampal cells in old animals som..."
4. [Label_0] "Use of Mental Models for Constraining Index Learning in Experience-Based Design Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to..."
5. [Label_6] "The Weighted Majority Algorithm Abstract: fl This research was primarily conducted while this author was at the University of Calif. at Santa Cruz wit..."

Text to classify:
"A Survey of Theory and Methods of Invariant Item Ordering
Abstract: This work was initiated while Junker was visiting the University of Utrecht with the support of a Carnegie Mellon University Faculty Development Grant, and the generous hospitality of the Social Sciences Faculty, University of Utrecht. Additional support was provided by the Office of Naval Research, Cognitive Sciences Division, Grant N00014-87-K-0277 and the National Institute of Mental Health, Training Grant MH15758."
