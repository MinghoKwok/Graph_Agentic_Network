ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 918 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214201:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Predictive Robot Control with Neural Networks
Abstract: Neural controllers are able to position the hand-held camera of the (3DOF) anthropomorphic OSCAR-robot manipulator above an object which is arbitrary placed on a table. The desired camera-joint mapping is approximated by feedforward neural networks. However, if the object is moving, the manipulator lags behind because of the required time to preprocess the visual information and to move the manipulator. Through the use of time derivatives of the position of the object and of the manipulator, the controller can inherently predict the next position of the object. In this paper several `predictive' controllers are proposed, and successfully applied to track a moving object."
