ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 357 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213305:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Genetic Algorithms as Multi-Coordinators in Large-Scale Optimization
Abstract: We present high-level, decomposition-based algorithms for large-scale block-angular optimization problems containing integer variables, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the solution of large-scale graph partitioning problems. These algorithms combine the subproblem-coordination paradigm (and lower bounds) of price-directive decomposition methods with knapsack and genetic approaches to the utilization of "building blocks" of partial solutions. Even for graph partitioning problems requiring billions of variables in a standard 0-1 formulation, this approach produces high-quality solutions (as measured by deviations from an easily computed lower bound), and substantially outperforms widely-used graph partitioning techniques based on heuristics and spectral methods."
