ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2384 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231933:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS OF PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A FINITE SET OF SAMPLES Part II: Bayes Estimators
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of two on the problem of estimating a function of a probability distribution from a finite set of samples of that distribution. In the first paper 1 , the Bayes estimator for a function of a probability distribution was introduced, the optimal properties of the Bayes estimator were discussed, and the Bayes and frequency-counts estimators for the Sh-annon entropy were derived and graphically contrasted. In the current paper the analysis of the first paper is extended by the derivation of Bayes estimators for several other functions of interest in statistics and information theory. These functions are (powers of) the mutual information, chi-squared for tests of independence, variance, covariance, and average. Finding Bayes estimators for several of these functions requires extensions to the analytical techniques developed in the first paper, and these extensions form the main body of this paper. This paper extends the analysis in other ways as well, for example by enlarging the class of potential priors beyond the uniform prior assumed in the first paper. In particular, the use of the entropic and Dirichlet priors is considered."
