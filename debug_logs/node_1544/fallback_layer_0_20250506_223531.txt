ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1544 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223531:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Monitoring in Embedded Agents
Abstract: Finding good monitoring strategies is an important process in the design of any embedded agent. We describe the nature of the monitoring problem, point out what makes it difficult, and show that while periodic monitoring strategies are often the easiest to derive, they are not always the most appropriate. We demonstrate mathematically and empirically that for a wide class of problems, the so-called "cupcake problems", there exists a simple strategy, interval reduction, that outperforms periodic monitoring. We also show how features of the environment may influence the choice of the optimal strategy. The paper concludes with some thoughts about a monitoring strategy taxonomy, and what its defining features might be."
