ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 364 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211320:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_2] "Fast Bounded Smooth Regression with Lazy Neural Trees Abstract: We propose the lazy neural tree (LNT) as the appropriate architecture for the realizat..."
4. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
5. [Label_2] "Optimal Alignments in Linear Space using Automaton-derived Cost Functions (Extended Abstract) Submitted to CPM'96 Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95]..."

Text to classify:
"Radial Basis Functions: L p -approximation orders with scattered centres
Abstract: In this paper we generalize several results on uniform approximation orders with radial basis functions in (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993) and (Dyn and Ron, 1993) to L p -approximation orders. These results apply, in particular, to approximants from spaces spanned by translates of radial basis functions by scattered centres. Examples to which our results apply include quasi-interpolation and least-squares approximation from radial function spaces."
