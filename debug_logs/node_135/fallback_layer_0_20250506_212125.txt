ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 135 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212125:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"More Efficient Windowing
Abstract: Windowing has been proposed as a procedure for efficient memory use in the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm. However, previous work has shown that windowing may often lead to a decrease in performance. In this work, we try to argue that separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms are more appropriate for windowing than divide-and-conquer algorithms, because they learn rules independently and are less susceptible to changes in class distributions. In particular, we will present a new windowing algorithm that achieves additional gains in efficiency by exploiting this property of separate-and-conquer algorithms. While the presented algorithm is only suitable for redundant, noise-free data sets, we will also briefly discuss the problem of noisy data in windowing and present some preliminary ideas how it might be solved with an extension of the algorithm introduced in this paper."
