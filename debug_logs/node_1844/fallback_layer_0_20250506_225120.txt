ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1844 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225120:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Two Methods for Hierarchy Learning in Reinforcement Environments
Abstract: This paper describes two methods for hierarchically organizing temporal behaviors. The first is more intuitive: grouping together common sequences of events into single units so that they may be treated as individual behaviors. This system immediately encounters problems, however, because the units are binary, meaning the behaviors must execute completely or not at all, and this hinders the construction of good training algorithms. The system also runs into difficulty when more than one unit is (or should be) active at the same time. The second system is a hierarchy of transition values. This hierarchy dynamically modifies the values that specify the degree to which one unit should follow another. These values are continuous, allowing the use of gradient descent during learning. Furthermore, many units are active at the same time as part of the system's normal functionings."
