ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1970 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223738:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
2. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
3. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."
4. [Label_2] "Shattering all sets of k points in "general position" requires (k 1)=2 parameters Abstract: For classes of concepts defined by certain classes of anal..."
5. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."

Text to classify:
"The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification
Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the optimal distance measure to use for 1 nearest-neighbour (1-NN) classification, and show that it reduces to squared Euclidean distance in feature space for function classes that can be expressed as linear combinations of a fixed set of features. PAC-like bounds are given on the sample-complexity required to learn the CDM. An experiment is presented in which a neural network CDM was learnt for a Japanese OCR environ ment and then used to do 1-NN classification."
