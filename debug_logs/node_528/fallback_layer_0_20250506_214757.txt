ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 528 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214757:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Minimax and Hamiltonian Dynamics of Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks
Abstract: A Lyapunov function for excitatory-inhibitory networks is constructed. The construction assumes symmetric interactions within excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons, and antisymmetric interactions between populations. The Lyapunov function yields sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of fixed points. If these conditions are violated, limit cycles may be stable. The relations of the Lyapunov function to optimization theory and classical mechanics are revealed by The dynamics of a neural network with symmetric interactions provably converges to fixed points under very general assumptions[1, 2]. This mathematical result helped to establish the paradigm of neural computation with fixed point attractors[3]. But in reality, interactions between neurons in the brain are asymmetric. Furthermore, the dynamical behaviors seen in the brain are not confined to fixed point attractors, but also include oscillations and complex nonperiodic behavior. These other types of dynamics can be realized by asymmetric networks, and may be useful for neural computation. For these reasons, it is important to understand the global behavior of asymmetric neural networks. The interaction between an excitatory neuron and an inhibitory neuron is clearly asymmetric. Here we consider a class of networks that incorporates this fundamental asymmetry of the brain's microcircuitry. Networks of this class have distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with antisymmetric interactions minimax and dissipative Hamiltonian forms of the network dynamics."
