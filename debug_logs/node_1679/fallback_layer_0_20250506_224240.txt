ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1679 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224240:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability,
Abstract: We compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms in the problem of prognos-tics of the femoral neck fracture recovery: the K-nearest neighbours algorithm, the semi-naive Bayesian classifier, backpropagation with weight elimination learning of the multilayered neural networks, the LFC (lookahead feature construction) algorithm, and the Assistant-I and Assistant-R algorithms for top down induction of decision trees using information gain and RELIEFF as search heuristics, respectively. We compare the prognostic accuracy and the explanation ability of different classifiers. Among the different algorithms the semi-naive Bayesian classifier and Assistant-R seem to be the most appropriate. We analyze the combination of decisions of several classifiers for solving prediction problems and show that the combined classifier improves both performance and the explanation ability."
