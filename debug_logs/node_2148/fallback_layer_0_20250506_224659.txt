ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2148 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224659:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
2. [Label_3] "Monte Carlo Implementation of Gaussian Process Models for Bayesian Regression and Classification Abstract: Technical Report No. 9702, Department of St..."
3. [Label_3] "Robustness Analysis of Bayesian Networks with Global Neighborhoods Abstract: This paper presents algorithms for robustness analysis of Bayesian networ..."
4. [Label_6] "A Statistical Approach to Solving the EBL Utility Problem Abstract: Many "learning from experience" systems use information extracted from problem sol..."
5. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."

"Bayesian Design for the Normal Linear Model with Unknown Error Variance
Abstract: Most of the Bayesian theory of optimal experimental design, for the normal linear model, has been developed under the restrictive assumption that the variance is known. In special cases, insensitivity of specific design criteria to specific prior assumptions on the variance has been demonstrated, but a general result to show the way in which Bayesian optimal designs are affected by prior information about the variance is lacking. This paper stresses the important distinction between expected utility functions and optimality criteria, examines a number of expected utility functions some of which possess interesting properties, and deserve wider use and derives the relevant Bayesian optimality criteria under normal assumptions. This unifying setup is useful for proving the main result of the paper, that clarifies the issue of designing for the normal linear model with unknown variance."
