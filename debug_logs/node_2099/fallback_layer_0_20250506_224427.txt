ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2099 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224427:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "KnightCap: A chess program that learns by combining TD() with minimax search Abstract: In this paper we present TDLeaf(), a variation on the TD() algo..."
2. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
3. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."
4. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
5. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."

Text to classify:
"Game Theory, On-line Prediction and Boosting
Abstract: We study the close connections between game theory, on-line prediction and boosting. After a brief review of game theory, we describe an algorithm for learning to play repeated games based on the on-line prediction methods of Littlestone and War-muth. The analysis of this algorithm yields a simple proof of von Neumann's famous minmax theorem, as well as a provable method of approximately solving a game. We then show that the on-line prediction model is obtained by applying this game-playing algorithm to an appropriate choice of game and that boosting is obtained by applying the same algorithm to the dual of this game."
