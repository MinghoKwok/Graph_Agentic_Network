ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1616 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223920:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"NeuroDraughts: the role of representation, search, training regime and architecture in a TD draughts player
Abstract: NeuroDraughts is a draughts playing program similar in approach to NeuroGammon and NeuroChess [Tesauro, 1992, Thrun, 1995]. It uses an artificial neural network trained by the method of temporal difference learning to learn by self-play how to play the game of draughts. This paper discusses the relative contribution of board representation, search depth, training regime, architecture and run time parameters to the strength of the TDplayer produced by the system. Keywords: Temporal Difference Learning, Input representation, Search, Draughts."
