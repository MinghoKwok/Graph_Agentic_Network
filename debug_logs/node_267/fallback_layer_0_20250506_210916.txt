ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 267 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210916:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On Learning from Noisy and Incomplete Examples
Abstract: We investigate learnability in the PAC model when the data used for learning, attributes and labels, is either corrupted or incomplete. In order to prove our main results, we define a new complexity measure on statistical query (SQ) learning algorithms. The view of an SQ algorithm is the maximum over all queries in the algorithm, of the number of input bits on which the query depends. We show that a restricted view SQ algorithm for a class is a general sufficient condition for learnability in both the models of attribute noise and covered (or missing) attributes. We further show that since the algorithms in question are statistical, they can also simultaneously tolerate classification noise. Classes for which these results hold, and can therefore be learned with simultaneous attribute noise and classification noise, include k-DNF, k-term-DNF by DNF representations, conjunctions with few relevant variables, and over the uniform distribution, decision lists. These noise models are the first PAC models in which all training data, attributes and labels, may be corrupted by a random process. Previous researchers had shown that the class of k-DNF is learnable with attribute noise if the attribute noise rate is known exactly. We show that all of our attribute noise learnabil-ity results, either with or without classification noise, also hold when the exact noise rate is not Appeared in Proceedings of the Eighth Annual ACM Conference on Computational Learning Theory. ACM Press, July 1995. known, provided that the learner instead has a polynomially good approximation of the noise rate. In addition, we show that the results also hold when there is not one single noise rate, but a distinct noise rate for each attribute. Our results for learning with random covering do not require the learner to be told even an approximation of the covering rate and in addition hold in the setting with distinct covering rates for each attribute. Finally, we give lower bounds on the number of examples required for learning in the presence of attribute noise or covering."
