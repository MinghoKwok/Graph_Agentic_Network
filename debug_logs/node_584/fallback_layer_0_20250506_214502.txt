ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 584 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214502:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A MEAN FIELD LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR UNSUPERVISED NEURAL NETWORKS
Abstract: We introduce a learning algorithm for unsupervised neural networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The algorithm is derived from a mean field approximation for large, layered sigmoid belief networks. We show how to (approximately) infer the statistics of these networks without resort to sampling. This is done by solving the mean field equations, which relate the statistics of each unit to those of its Markov blanket. Using these statistics as target values, the weights in the network are adapted by a local delta rule. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these networks for problems in statistical pattern recognition."
