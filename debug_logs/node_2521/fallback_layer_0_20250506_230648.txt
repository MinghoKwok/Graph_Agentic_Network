ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2521 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230648:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Case-Based Probability Factoring in Bayesian Belief Networks
Abstract: Bayesian network inference can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, concerning in the computation of an optimal factoring for the distribution represented in the net. Since the determination of an optimal factoring is a computationally hard problem, heuristic greedy strategies able to find approximations of the optimal factoring are usually adopted. In the present paper we investigate an alternative approach based on a combination of genetic algorithms (GA) and case-based reasoning (CBR). We show how the use of genetic algorithms can improve the quality of the computed factoring in case a static strategy is used (as for the MPE computation), while the combination of GA and CBR can still provide advantages in the case of dynamic strategies. Some preliminary results on different kinds of nets are then reported."
