ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2488 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230502:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."
3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_3] "BAYESIAN TIME SERIES: Models and Computations for the Analysis of Time Series in the Physical Sciences Abstract: This articles discusses developments ..."

"Density and hazard rate estimation for right censored data using wavelet methods
Abstract: This paper describes a wavelet method for the estimation of density and hazard rate functions from randomly right censored data. We adopt a nonparametric approach in assuming that the density and hazard rate have no specific parametric form. The method is based on dividing the time axis into a dyadic number of intervals and then counting the number of events within each interval. The number of events and the survival function of the observations are then separately smoothed over time via linear wavelet smoothers, and then the hazard rate function estimators are obtained by taking the ratio. We prove that the estimators possess pointwise and global mean square consistency, obtain the best possible asymptotic MISE convergence rate and are also asymptotically normally distributed. We also describe simulation experiments that show these estimators are reasonably reliable in practice. The method is illustrated with two real examples. The first uses survival time data for patients with liver metastases from a colorectal primary tumour without other distant metastases. The second is concerned with times of unemployment for women and the wavelet estimate, through its flexibility, provides a new and interesting interpretation."
