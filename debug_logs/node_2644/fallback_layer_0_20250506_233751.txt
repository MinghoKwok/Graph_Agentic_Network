ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2644 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233751:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Bayesian Induction of Features in Temporal Domains
Abstract: Most concept induction algorithms process concept instances described in terms of properties that remain constant over time. In temporal domains, instances are best described in terms of properties whose values vary with time. Data engineering is called upon in temporal domains to transform the raw data into an appropriate form for concept induction. I investigate a method for inducing features suitable for classifying finite, univariate, time series that are governed by unknown deterministic processes contaminated by noise. In a supervised setting, I induce piecewise polynomials of appropriate complexity to characterize the data in each class, using Bayesian model induction principles. In this study, I evaluate the proposed method empirically in a semi-deterministic domain: the waveform classification problem, originally presented in the CART book. I compared the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm to the accuracy attained by C4.5 under various noise levels. Feature induction improved the classification accuracy in noisy situations, but degraded it when there was no noise. The results demonstrate the value of the proposed method in the presence of noise, and reveal a weakness shared by all classifiers using generative rather than discriminative models: sensitivity to model inaccuracies."
