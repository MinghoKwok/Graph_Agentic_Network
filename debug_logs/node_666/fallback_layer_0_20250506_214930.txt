ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 666 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214930:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"NeuroPipe a neural network based system for pipeline inspec-
Abstract: Gas, oil and other pipelines need to be inspected for corrosion and other defects at regular intervals. For this application Pipetronix GmbH (PTX) Karlsruhe has developed a special ultrasonic based probe. Based on the recorded wall thicknesses of this so called pipe pig the Research center for computer science (FZI) has developed in cooperation with PTX an automatic inspection system called NeuroPipe. NeuroPipe has the task to detect defects like metal loss. The kernel of this inspection tool is a neural classifier which was trained using manually collected defect examples. The following paper focus on the aspects of successfull use of learning methods in an industrial application."
