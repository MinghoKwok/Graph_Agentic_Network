ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 442 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214321:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Searching for dependencies in Bayesian classifiers j A n V n j If the attributes
Abstract: Naive Bayesian classifiers which make independence assumptions perform remarkably well on some data sets but poorly on others. We explore ways to improve the Bayesian classifier by searching for dependencies among attributes. We propose and evaluate two algorithms for detecting dependencies among attributes and show that the backward sequential elimination and joining algorithm provides the most improvement over the naive Bayesian classifier. The domains on which the most improvement occurs are those domains on which the naive Bayesian classifier is significantly less accurate than a decision tree learner. This suggests that the attributes used in some common databases are not independent conditioned on the class and that the violations of the independence assumption that affect the accuracy of the classifier The Bayesian classifier (Duda & Hart, 1973) is a probabilistic method for classification. It can be used to determine the probability that an example j belongs to class C i given values of attributes of an example represented as a set of n nominally-valued attribute-value pairs of the form A 1 = V 1 j : ^ P (A k = V k j jC i ) may be estimated from the training data. To determine the most likely class of a test example, the probability of each class is computed with Equation 1. A classifier created in this manner is sometimes called a simple (Langley, 1993) or naive (Kononenko, 1990) Bayesian classifier. One important evaluation metric for machine learning methods is the predictive accuracy on unseen examples. This is measured by randomly selecting a subset of the examples in a database to use as training examples and reserving the remainder to be used as test examples. In the case of the simple Bayesian classifier, the training examples are used to estimate probabilities and Equation 1.1 is then used can be detected from training data."
