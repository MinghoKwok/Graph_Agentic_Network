ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2613 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233631:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Genetic Algorithms for Automated Tuning of Fuzzy Controllers: A Transportation Application
Abstract: We describe the design and tuning of a controller for enforcing compliance with a prescribed velocity profile for a rail-based transportation system. This requires following a trajectory, rather than fixed set-points (as in automobiles). We synthesize a fuzzy controller for tracking the velocity profile, while providing a smooth ride and staying within the prescribed speed limits. We use a genetic algorithm to tune the fuzzy controller's performance by adjusting its parameters (the scaling factors and the membership functions) in a sequential order of significance. We show that this approach results in a controller that is superior to the manually designed one, and with only modest computational effort. This makes it possible to customize automated tuning to a variety of different configurations of the route, the terrain, the power configuration, and the cargo."
