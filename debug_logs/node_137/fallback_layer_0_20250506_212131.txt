ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 137 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212131:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration."
