ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 434 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211630:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Computational Learning in Humans and Machines
Abstract: In this paper we review research on machine learning and its relation to computational models of human learning. We focus initially on concept induction, examining five main approaches to this problem, then consider the more complex issue of learning sequential behaviors. After this, we compare the rhetoric that sometimes appears in the machine learning and psychological literature with the growing evidence that different theoretical paradigms typically produce similar results. In response, we suggest that concrete computational models, which currently dominate the field, may be less useful than simulations that operate at a more abstract level. We illustrate this point with an abstract simulation that explains a challenging phenomenon in the area of category learning, and we conclude with some general observations about such abstract models."
