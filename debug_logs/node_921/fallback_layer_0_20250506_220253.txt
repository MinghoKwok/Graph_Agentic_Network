ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 921 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220253:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"DIAGNOSING AND CORRECTING SYSTEM ANOMALIES WITH A ROBUST CLASSIFIER
Abstract: If a robust statistical model has been developed to classify the ``health'' of a system, a well-known Taylor series approximation technique forms the basis of a diagnostic/recovery procedure that can be initiated when the system's health degrades or fails altogether. This procedure determines a ranked set of probable causes for the degraded health state, which can be used as a prioritized checklist for isolating system anomalies and quantifying corrective action. The diagnostic/recovery procedure is applicable to any classifier known to be robust; it can be applied to both neural network and traditional parametric pattern classifiers generated by a supervised learning procedure in which an empirical risk/benefit measure is optimized. We describe the procedure mathematically and demonstrate its ability to detect and diagnose the cause(s) of faults in NASA's Deep Space Communications Complex at Goldstone, California."
