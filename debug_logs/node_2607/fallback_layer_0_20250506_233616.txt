ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2607 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233616:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Concept Learning and Flexible Weighting
Abstract: We previously introduced an exemplar model, named GCM-ISW, that exploits a highly flexible weighting scheme. Our simulations showed that it records faster learning rates and higher asymptotic accuracies on several artificial categorization tasks than models with more limited abilities to warp input spaces. This paper extends our previous work; it describes experimental results that suggest human subjects also invoke such highly flexible schemes. In particular, our model provides significantly better fits than models with less flexibility, and we hypothesize that humans selectively weight attributes depending on an item's location in the input space. We need more flexible models Many theories of human concept learning posit that concepts are represented by prototypes (Reed, 1972) or exemplars (Medin & Schaffer, 1978). Prototype models represent concepts by the "best example" or "central tendency" of the concept. 1 A new item belongs in a category C if it is relatively similar to C's prototype. Prototype models are relatively inflexible; they discard a great deal of information that people use during concept learning (e.g., the number of exemplars in a concept (Homa & Cultice, 1984), the variability of features (Fried & Holyoak, 1984), correlations between features (Medin et al., 1982), and the particular exemplars used (Whittlesea, 1987)). of concept learning"
