ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 118 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210258:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning with Modular Neural Networks for Control Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods can be applied to control problems with the o..."
3. [Label_1] "ADAPTIVE TESTING OF CONTROLLERS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to main..."
4. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
5. [Label_4] "Towards a Reactive Critic Abstract: In this paper we propose a reactive critic, that is able to respond to changing situations. We will explain why th..."

Text to classify:
"Learning to Race: Experiments with a Simulated Race Car
Abstract: We have implemented a reinforcement learning architecture as the reactive component of a two layer control system for a simulated race car. We have found that separating the layers has expedited gradually improving competition and mult-agent interaction. We ran experiments to test the tuning, decomposition and coordination of the low level behaviors. We then extended our control system to allow passing of other cars and tested its ability to avoid collisions. The best design used reinforcement learning with separate networks for each behavior, coarse coded input and a simple rule based coordination mechanism."
