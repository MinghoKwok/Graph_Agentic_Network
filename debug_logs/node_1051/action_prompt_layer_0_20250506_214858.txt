    "Interpreting neuronal population activity by reconstruction: A unified framework with application to hippocampal place cells
Abstract: Physical variables such as the orientation of a line in the visual field or the location of the body in space are coded as activity levels in populations of neurons. Reconstruction or decoding is an inverse problem in which the physical variables are estimated from observed neural activity. Reconstruction is useful first in quantifying how much information about the physical variables is present in the population, and second, in providing insight into how the brain might use distributed representations in solving related computational problems such as visual object recognition and spatial navigation. Two classes of reconstruction methods, namely, probabilistic or Bayesian methods and basis function methods, are discussed. They include important existing methods as special cases, such as population vector coding, optimal linear estimation and template matching. As a representative example for the reconstruction problem, different methods were applied to multi-electrode spike train data from hippocampal place cells in freely moving rats. The reconstruction accuracy of the trajectories of the rats was compared for the different methods. Bayesian methods were especially accurate when a continuity constraint was enforced, and the best errors were within a factor of two of the the information-theoretic limit on how accurate any reconstruction can be, which were comparable with the intrinsic experimental errors in position tracking. In addition, the reconstruction analysis uncovered some interesting aspects of place cell activity, such as the tendency for erratic jumps of the reconstructed trajectory when the animal stopped running. In general, the theoretical values of the minimal achievable reconstruction errors quantify how accurately a physical variable is encoded in the neuronal population in the sense of mean square error, regardless of the method used for reading out the information. One related result is that the theoretical accuracy is independent of the width of the Gaussian tuning function only in two dimensions. Finally, all the reconstruction methods considered in this paper can be implemented by a unified neural network architecture, which the brain could feasibly use to solve related problems."

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
