ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1194 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215636:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
2. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."
5. [Label_4] "Planning by Incremental Dynamic Programming Abstract: This paper presents the basic results and ideas of dynamic programming as they relate most direc..."

Text to classify:
"An Explanation-Based Approach to Improve Retrieval in Case-Based Planning
Abstract: When a case-based planner is retrieving a previous case in preparation for solving a new similar problem, it is often not aware of the implicit features of the new problem situation which determine if a particular case may be successfully applied. This means that some cases may be retrieved in error in that the case may fail to improve the planner's performance. Retrieval may be incrementally improved by detecting and explaining these failures as they occur. In this paper we provide a definition of case failure for the planner, dersnlp (derivation replay in snlp), which solves new problems by replaying its previous plan derivations. We provide EBL (explanation-based learning) techniques for detecting and constructing the reasons for the failure. We also describe how to organize a case library so as to incorporate this failure information as it is produced. Finally we present an empirical study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in improving the performance of dersnlp."
