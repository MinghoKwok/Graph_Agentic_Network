ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2641 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231307:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Toward Simulated Evolution of Machine-Language Iteration
Abstract: We use a simulated evolution search (genetic programming) for the automatic synthesis of small iterative machine-language programs. For an integer register machine with an addition instruction as its sole arithmetic operator, we show that genetic programming can produce exact and general multiplication routines by synthesizing the necessary iterative control structures from primitive machine-language instructions. Our program representation is a virtual register machine that admits arbitrary control flow. Our evolution strategy furthermore does not artificially restrict the synthesis of any control structure; we only place an upper bound on program evaluation time. A program's fitness is the distance between the output produced by a test case and the desired output (multiplication). The test cases exhaustively cover multiplication over a finite subset of the natural numbers (N 10 ); yet the derived solutions constitute general multiplication for the positive integers. For this problem, simulated evolution with a two-point crossover operator examines significantly fewer individuals in finding a solution than random search. Introduction of a small rate of mutation fur ther increases the number of solutions."
