ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 142 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212732:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION VIA LINEAR PROGRAMMING THEORY AND APPLICATION TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS
Abstract: A decision problem associated with a fundamental nonconvex model for linearly inseparable pattern sets is shown to be NP-complete. Another nonconvex model that employs an 1 norm instead of the 2-norm, can be solved in polynomial time by solving 2n linear programs, where n is the (usually small) dimensionality of the pattern space. An effective LP-based finite algorithm is proposed for solving the latter model. The algorithm is employed to obtain a noncon-vex piecewise-linear function for separating points representing measurements made on fine needle aspirates taken from benign and malignant human breasts. A computer program trained on 369 samples has correctly diagnosed each of 45 new samples encountered and is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. 1. Introduction. The fundamental problem we wish to address is that of"
