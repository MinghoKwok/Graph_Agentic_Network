ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1873 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223230:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "ce: [Tex89] <institution> Texas Instruments. </institution> <note> TMS320C30 C Compiler Reference Guide, 1989. Document Title: SPRU034A. </note> Abstr..."
2. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
3. [Label_2] "MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T..."
4. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."
5. [Label_5] "Modeling Superscalar Processors via Statistical Simulation Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"Achieving Super Computer Performance with a DSP Array Processor
Abstract: The MUSIC system (MUlti Signal processor system with Intelligent Communication) is a parallel distributed memory architecture based on digital signal processors (DSP). A system with 60 processor elements is operational. It has a peak performance of 3.8 GFlops, an electrical power consumption of less than 800 W (including forced air cooling) and fits into a 19" rack. Two applications (the back-propagation algorithm for neural net learning and molecular dynamics simulations) run about 6 times faster than on a CRAY Y-MP and 2 times faster than on a NEC SX-3. A sustained performance of more than 1 GFlops is reached. The selling price of such a system would be in the range of about 300'000 US$."
