ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1533 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223457:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolving Visual Routines
Abstract: Traditional machine vision assumes that the vision system recovers a a complete, labeled description of the world [ Marr, 1982 ] . Recently, several researchers have criticized this model and proposed an alternative model which considers perception as a distributed collection of task-specific, task-driven visual routines [ Aloimonos, 1993, Ullman, 1987 ] . Some of these researchers have argued that in natural living systems these visual routines are the product of natural selection [ Ramachandran, 1985 ] . So far, researchers have hand-coded task-specific visual routines for actual implementations (e.g. [ Chapman, 1993 ] ). In this paper we propose an alternative approach in which visual routines for simple tasks are evolved using an artificial evolution approach. We present results from a series of runs on actual camera images, in which simple routines were evolved using Genetic Programming techniques [ Koza, 1992 ] . The results obtained are promising: the evolved routines are able to correctly classify up to 93% of the images, which is better than the best algorithm we were able to write by hand."
