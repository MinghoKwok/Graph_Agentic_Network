ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1146 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215404:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"The optimal number of learning samples and hidden units in function approximation with a feedforward network
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to estimate the optimal number of learning samples and the number of hidden units needed to obtain a desired accuracy of a function approximation by a feedforward network. The representation error and the generalization error, components of the total approximation error are analyzed and the approximation accuracy of a feedforward network is investigated as a function of the number of hidden units and the number of learning samples. Based on the asymptotical behavior of the approximation error, an asymptotical model of the error function (AMEF) is introduced of which the parameters can be determined experimentally. An alternative model of the error function, which include theoretical results about general bounds of approximation, is also analyzed. In combination with knowledge about the computational complexity of the learning rule an optimal learning set size and number of hidden units can be found resulting in a minimum computation time for a given desired precision of the approximation. This approach was applied to optimize the learning of the camera-robot mapping of a visually guided robot arm and a complex logarithm function approximation."
