ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2118 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231213:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On Step-Size and Bias in Temporal-Difference Learning
Abstract: We present results for three new algorithms for setting the step-size parameters, ff and , of temporal-difference learning methods such as TD(). The overall task is that of learning to predict the outcome of an unknown Markov chain based on repeated observations of its state trajectories. The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods. We compare our algorithms with conventional Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods have a natural way of setting the step size: for each state s they use a step size of 1=n s , where n s is the number of times state s has been visited. We seek and come close to achieving comparable step-size algorithms for TD(). One new algorithm uses a = 1=n s schedule to achieve the same effect as processing a state backwards with TD(0), but remains completely incremental. Another algorithm uses a at each time equal to the estimated transition probability of the current transition. We present empirical results showing improvement in convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods and conventional TD(). A limitation of our results at present is that they apply only to tasks whose state trajectories do not contain cycles."
