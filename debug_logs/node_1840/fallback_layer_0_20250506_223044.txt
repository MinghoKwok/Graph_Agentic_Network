You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Hierarchical Genetic Programming (HGP) extensions discover, modify, and exploit subroutines to accelerate the evolution of
Abstract: A fundamental problem in learning from observation and interaction with an environment is defining a good representation, that is a representation which captures the underlying structure and functionality of the domain. This chapter discusses an extension of the genetic programming (GP) paradigm based on the idea that subroutines obtained from blocks of good representations act as building blocks and may enable a faster evolution of even better representations. This GP extension algorithm is called adaptive representation through learning (ARL). It has built-in mechanisms for (1) creation of new subroutines through discovery and generalization of blocks of code; (2) deletion of subroutines. The set of evolved subroutines extracts common knowledge emerging during the evolutionary process and acquires the necessary structure for solving the problem. ARL was successfully tested on the problem of controlling an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment. Results with the automatic discovery of subroutines show the potential to better scale up the GP technique to complex problems. While HGP approaches improve the efficiency and scalability of genetic programming (GP) for many applications [Koza, 1994b], several issues remain unresolved. The scalability of HGP techniques could be further improved by solving two such issues. One is the characterization of the value of subroutines. Current methods for HGP do not attempt to decide what is relevant, i.e. which blocks of code or subroutines may be worth giving special attention, but employ genetic operations on subroutines at random points. The other issue is the time-course of the generation of new subroutines. Current HGP techniques do not make informed choices to automatically decide when creation or modification of subroutines is advantageous or necessary. The Adaptive Representation through Learning (ARL) algorithm copes with both of these problems. The what issue is addressed by relying on local measures such as parent-offspring differential fitness and block activation in order to discover useful subroutines and by learning which subroutines are useful. The when issue is addressed by relying on global population measures such as population entropy in order to predict when search reaches local optima and escape them. ARL co-evolves a set of subroutines which extends the set of problem primitives."
