ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1448 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221002:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
2. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_6] "A Statistical Approach to Solving the EBL Utility Problem Abstract: Many "learning from experience" systems use information extracted from problem sol..."
5. [Label_0] "Use of Mental Models for Constraining Index Learning in Experience-Based Design Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to..."

Text to classify:
"Automatic Storage and Indexing of Plan Derivations based on Replay Failures
Abstract: When a case-based planner is retrieving a previous case in preparation for solving a new similar problem, it is often not aware of all of the implicit features of the new problem situation which determine if a particular case may be successfully applied. This means that some cases may fail to improve the planner's performance. By detecting and explaining these case failures as they occur, retrieval may be improved incrementally. In this paper we provide a definition of case failure for the case-based planner, dersnlp (derivation replay in snlp), which solves new problems by replaying its previous plan derivations. We provide explanation-based learning (EBL) techniques for detecting and constructing the reasons for the case failure. We also describe how the case library is organized so as to incorporate this failure information as it is produced. Finally we present an empirical study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in improving the performance of dersnlp."
