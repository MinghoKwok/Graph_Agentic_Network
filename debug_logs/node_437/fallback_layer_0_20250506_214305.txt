ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 437 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214305:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_1: 5 examples
- Label_2: 4 examples
- Label_4: 1 examples
- Label_6: 1 examples

2. [Label_2] "Homology Detection via Family Pairwise Search a straightforward generalization of pairwise sequence comparison algorithms to Abstract: The function of..."

"A Gentle Guide to Multiple Alignment Version Please send comments, critique, flames and praise Instructions
Abstract: Prerequisites. An understanding of the dynamic programming (edit distance) approach to pairwise sequence alignment is useful for parts 1.3, 1.4, and 2. Also, familiarity with the use of Internet resources would be helpful for part 3. For the former, see Chapters 1.1 - 1.3, and for the latter, see Chapter 2 of the Hypertext Book of the GNA-VSNS Biocomputing Course at http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/bcd/Curric/welcome.html. General Rationale. You will understand why Multiple Alignment is considered a challenging problem, you will study approaches that try to reduce the number of steps needed to calculate the optimal solution, and you will study fast heuristics. In a case study involving immunoglobulin sequences, you will study multiple alignments obtained from WWW servers, recapitulating results from an original paper. Revision History. Version 1.01 on 17 Sep 1995. Expanded Ex.9. Updated Ex.46. Revised Solution Sheet -re- Ex.3+12. Marked more Exercises by "A" (to be submitted to the Instructor). Various minor clarifications in content"
