ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1349 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222515:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Robust performance and adaptation using receding horizon H 1 control of time varying systems.
Abstract: In this paper we construct suboptimal H 1 controllers which satisfy a new robust performance condition, using the receding horizon technique. A method is described for the synthesis of H 1 controllers online, making use of the exact plant model only on a finite interval extending into the future. Inequalities based on the two Riccati differential equation solution to the finite horizon H 1 problem are derived, and the resulting freedom is exploited to construct H 1 controllers which have a closed loop induced norm less than a prespecified value for all plants within a set, which is described in terms of the future variation of the plant. Dual results, with a possible adaptive interpretation, are also constructed."
