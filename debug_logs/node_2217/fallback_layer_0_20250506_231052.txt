ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2217 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231052:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Application of Clausal Discovery to Temporal Databases
Abstract: Most of KDD applications consider databases as static objects, and however many databases are inherently temporal, i.e., they store the evolution of each object with the passage of time. Thus, regularities about the dynamics of these databases cannot be discovered as the current state might depend in some way on the previous states. To this end, a pre-processing of data is needed aimed at extracting relationships intimately connected to the temporal nature of data that will be make available to the discovery algorithm. The predicate logic language of ILP methods together with the recent advances as to ef ficiency makes them adequate for this task."
