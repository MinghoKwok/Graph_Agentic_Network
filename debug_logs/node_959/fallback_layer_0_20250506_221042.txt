ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 959 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221042:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Numerical techniques for efficient sonar bearing and range searching in the near field using genetic algorithms
Abstract: This article describes a numerical method that may be used to efficiently locate and track underwater sonar targets in the near-field, with both bearing and range estimation, for the case of very large passive arrays. The approach used has no requirement for a priori knowledge about the source and uses only limited information about the receiver array shape. The role of sensor position uncertainty and the consequence of targets always being in the near-field are analysed and the problems associated with the manipulation of large matrices inherent in conventional eigenvalue type algorithms noted. A simpler numerical approach is then presented which reduces the problem to that of search optimization. When using this method the location of a target corresponds to finding the position of the maximum weighted sum of the output from all sensors. Since this search procedure can be dealt with using modern stochastic optimization methods, such as the genetic algorithm, the operational requirement that an acceptable accuracy be achieved in real time can usually be met. The array studied here consists of 225 elements positioned along a flexible cable towed behind a ship with 3.4m between sensors, giving an effective aperture of 761.6m. For such a long array, the far field assumption used in most beam-forming algorithms is no longer appropriate. The waves emitted by the targets then have to be considered as curved rather than plane. It is shown that, for simulated data, if no significant noise"
