ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2282 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231416:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The ILP description learning problem: Towards a general model-level definition of data mining in ILP
Abstract: stefan.wrobel@gmd.de, saso.dzeroski@gmd.de Proc. FGML-95, Annual Workshop of the GI Special Interest Group Machine Learning (GI FG 1.1.3), ed. K. Morik and J. Herrmann, Research Report 580, Univ.Dortmund, 1995. Abstract The task of discovering interesting regularities in (large) sets of data (data mining, knowledge discovery) has recently met with increased interest in Machine Learning in general and in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in particular. However, while there is a widely accepted definition for the task of concept learning from examples in ILP, definitions for the data mining task have been proposed only recently. In this paper, we examine these so-called "non-monotonic semantics" definitions and show that non-monotonicity is only an incidental property of the data mining learning task, and that this task makes perfect sense without such an assumption. We therefore introduce and define a generalized definition of the data mining task called the ILP description learning problem and discuss its properties and relation to the traditional concept learning (prediction) learning problem. Since our characterization is entirely on the level of models, the definition applies independently of the chosen hypothesis language."
