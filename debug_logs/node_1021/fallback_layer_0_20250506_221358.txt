ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1021 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221358:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Lemma 2.3 The system is reachable and observable and realizes the same input/output behavior as
Abstract: Here we show a similar construction for multiple-output systems, with some modifications. Let = (A; B; C) s be a discrete-time sign-linear system with state space IR n and p outputs. Perform a change of ; where A 1 (n 1 fi n 1 ) is invertible and A 2 (n 2 fi n 2 ) is nilpotent. If (A; B) is a reachable pair and (A; C) is an observable pair, then is minimal in the sense that any other sign-linear system with the same input/output behavior has dimension at least n. But, if n 1 &lt; n, then det A = 0 and is not observable and hence not canonical. Let us find another system ~ (necessarily not sign-linear) which has the same input/output behavior as , but is canonical. Let i be the relative degree of the ith row of the Markov sequence A, and = minf i : i = 1; : : : ; pg. Let the initial state be x. There is a difference between the case when the smallest relative degree is greater or equal to n 2 and the case when &lt; n 2 . Roughly speaking, when n 2 the outputs of the sign-linear system give us information about sign (Cx), sign (CAx), : : : , sign (CA 1 x), which are the first outputs of the sys tem. After that, we can use the inputs and outputs to learn only about x 1 (the first n 1 components of x). When &lt; n 2 , we may be able to use some controls to learn more about x 2 (the last n 2 components of x) before time n 2 when the nilpotency of A 2 has finally Lemma 2.4 Two states x and z are indistinguishable for if and only if (x) = (z). Proof. In the case n 2 , we have only the equations x 1 = z 1 and the equality of the 's. The first ` output terms for are exactly the terms of . So these equalities are satisfied if and only if the first ` output terms coincide for x and z, for any input. Equality of everything but the first n 1 components is equivalent to the first n 2 output terms coinciding for x and z, since the jth row of the qth output, for initial state x, for example, is either sign (c j A q x) if j &gt; q, or sign (c j A q x + + A j j u q j +1 + ) if j q in which case we may use the control u q j +1 to identify c j A q x (using Remark 3.3 in [1])."
