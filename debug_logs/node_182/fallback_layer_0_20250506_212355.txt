ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 182 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212355:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Adaptation for Self Regenerative MCMC  SUMMARY
Abstract: The self regenerative MCMC is a tool for constructing a Markov chain with a given stationary distribution by constructing an auxiliary chain with some other stationary distribution . Elements of the auxiliary chain are picked a suitable random number of times so that the resulting chain has the stationary distribution , Sahu and Zhigljavsky (1998). In this article we provide a generic adaptation scheme for the above algorithm. The adaptive scheme is to use the knowledge of the stationary distribution gathered so far and then to update during the course of the simulation. This method is easy to implement and often leads to considerable improvement. We obtain theoretical results for the adaptive scheme. Our proposed methodology is illustrated with a number of realistic examples in Bayesian computation and its performance is compared with other available MCMC techniques. In one of our applications we develop a non-linear dynamics model for modeling predator-prey relationships in the wild."
