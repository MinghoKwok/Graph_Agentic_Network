ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1801 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224905:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A FAMILY OF FIXED-POINT ALGORITHMS FOR INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical signal processing technique whose main applications are blind source separation, blind deconvolution, and feature extraction. Estimation of ICA is usually performed by optimizing a 'contrast' function based on higher-order cumulants. In this paper, it is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for tnding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a txed-point iteration scheme is then introduced. The resulting algorithms are quite simple and converge fast and reliably. These algorithms also enable estimation of the independent components one-by-one, using a simple deation scheme."
