ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2637 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233732:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Computational Environment for Exhaust Nozzle Design
Abstract: The Nozzle Design Associate (NDA) is a computational environment for the design of jet engine exhaust nozzles for supersonic aircraft. NDA may be used either to design new aircraft or to design new nozzles that adapt existing aircraft so they may be reutilized for new missions. NDA was developed in a collaboration between computer scientists at Rut-gers University and exhaust nozzle designers at General Electric Aircraft Engines and General Electric Corporate Research and Development. The NDA project has two principal goals: to provide a useful engineering tool for exhaust nozzle design, and to explore fundamental research issues that arise in the application of automated design optimization methods to realistic engineering problems."
