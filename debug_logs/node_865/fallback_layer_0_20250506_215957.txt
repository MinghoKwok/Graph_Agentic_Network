ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 865 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215957:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"ON THE SAMPLE COMPLEXITY OF FINDING GOOD SEARCH STRATEGIES 2n trials of each undetermined experiment
Abstract: A satisficing search problem consists of a set of probabilistic experiments to be performed in some order, without repetitions, until a satisfying configuration of successes and failures has been reached. The cost of performing the experiments depends on the order chosen. Earlier work has concentrated on finding optimal search strategies in special cases of this model, such as search trees and and-or graphs, when the cost function and the success probabilities for the experiments are given. In contrast, we study the complexity of "learning" an approximately optimal search strategy when some of the success probabilities are not known at the outset. Working in the fully general model, we show that if n is the number of unknown probabilities, and C is the maximum cost of performing all the experiments, then"
