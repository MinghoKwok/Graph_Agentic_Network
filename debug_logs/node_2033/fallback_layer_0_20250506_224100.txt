ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2033 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224100:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."
3. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
4. [Label_0] "Context-Sensitive Feature Selection for Lazy Learners Abstract:"
5. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."

"Improving RBF Networks by the Feature Selection Approach EUBAFES
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality is one of the severest problems concerning the application of RBF networks. The number of RBF nodes and therefore the number of training examples needed grows exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the input space. One way to address this problem is the application of feature selection as a data preprocessing step. In this paper we propose a two-step approach for the determination of an optimal feature subset: First, all possible feature-subsets are reduced to those with best discrimination properties by the application of the fast and robust filter technique EUBAFES. Secondly we use a wrapper approach to judge, which of the pre-selected feature subsets leads to RBF networks with least complexity and best classification accuracy. Experiments are undertaken to show the improvement for RBF networks by our feature selection approach."
