ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1725 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222442:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than sin..."
2. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
3. [Label_0] "EXPLORING A FRAMEWORK FOR INSTANCE BASED LEARNING AND NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIERS Abstract: The relative performance of different methods for classifie..."
4. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
5. [Label_6] "Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve fi..."

Text to classify:
"DIFFERENTIALLY GENERATED NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIERS ARE EFFICIENT
Abstract: Differential learning for statistical pattern classification is described in [5]; it is based on the classification figure-of-merit (CFM) objective function described in [9, 5]. We prove that differential learning is asymptotically efficient, guaranteeing the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class (see below) as the training sample size grows large, while requiring the least classifier complexity necessary for Bayesian (i.e., minimum probability-of-error) discrimination. Moreover, differential learning almost always guarantees the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class for small training sample sizes."
