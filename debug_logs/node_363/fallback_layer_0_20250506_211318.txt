ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 363 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211318:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Representing Rhythmic Patterns in a Network of Oscillators
Abstract: This paper describes an evolving computational model of the perception and production of simple rhythmic patterns. The model consists of a network of oscillators of different resting frequencies which couple with input patterns and with each other. Oscillators whose frequencies match periodicities in the input tend to become activated. Metrical structure is represented explicitly in the network in the form of clusters of oscillators whose frequencies and phase angles are constrained to maintain the harmonic relationships that characterize meter. Rests in rhythmic patterns are represented by explicit rest oscillators in the network, which become activated when an expected beat in the pattern fails to appear. The model makes predictions about the relative difficulty of The nested periodicity that defines musical, and probably also linguistic, meter appears to be fundamental to the way in which people perceive and produce patterns in time. Meter by itself, however, is not sufficient to describe patterns which are interesting or memorable because of how they deviate from the metrical hierarchy. The simplest deviations are rests or gaps where one or more levels in the hierarchy would normally have a beat. When beats are removed at regular intervals which match the period of some level of the metrical hierarchy, we have what we will call a simple rhythmic pattern. Figure 1 shows an example of a simple rhythmic pattern. Below it is a grid representation of the meter which is behind the pattern. patterns and the effect of deviations from periodicity in the input."
