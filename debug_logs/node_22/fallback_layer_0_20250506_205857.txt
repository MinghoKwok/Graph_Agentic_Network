ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 22 | Layer 0 | 20250506_205857:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
3. [Label_4] "KnightCap: A chess program that learns by combining TD() with minimax search Abstract: In this paper we present TDLeaf(), a variation on the TD() algo..."
4. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."
5. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."

Text to classify:
"Discovering Complex Othello Strategies Through Evolutionary Neural Networks
Abstract: An approach to develop new game playing strategies based on artificial evolution of neural networks is presented. Evolution was directed to discover strategies in Othello against a random-moving opponent and later against an ff-fi search program. The networks discovered first a standard positional strategy, and subsequently a mobility strategy, an advanced strategy rarely seen outside of tournaments. The latter discovery demonstrates how evolutionary neural networks can develop novel solutions by turning an initial disadvantage into an advantage in a changed environment."
