ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2060 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230240:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Similarity-Based Retrieval Tool for Software Repositories
Abstract: In this paper we present a prototype of a flexible similarity-based retrieval system. Its flexibility is supported by allowing for an imprecisely specified query. Moreover, our algorithm allows for assessing if the retrieved items are relevant in the initial context, specified in the query. The presented system can be used as a supporting tool for a software repository. We also discuss system evaluation with concerns on usefulness, scalability, applicability and comparability. Evaluation of the T A3 system on three domains gives us encouraging results and an integration of TA3 into a real software repository as a retrieval tool is ongoing."
