ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2370 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232453:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_2: 2 examples

Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Robust performance and adaptation using receding horizon H 1 control of time varying systems. Abstract: In this paper we construct suboptimal H 1 cont..."
2. [Label_2] "Avoiding Saturation By Trajectory Reparameterization Abstract: The problem of trajectory tracking in the presence of input constraints is considered. ..."
3. [Label_4] "Improving Policies without Measuring Merits Abstract: Performing policy iteration in dynamic programming should only require knowledge of relative rat..."
4. [Label_4] "Towards a Reactive Critic Abstract: In this paper we propose a reactive critic, that is able to respond to changing situations. We will explain why th..."
5. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."

Text to classify:
"CONTROL-LYAPUNOV FUNCTIONS FOR TIME-VARYING SET STABILIZATION
Abstract: This paper shows that, for time varying systems, global asymptotic controllability to a given closed subset of the state space is equivalent to the existence of a continuous control-Lyapunov function with respect to the set."
