ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 126 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212055:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Perfect Simulation of some Point Processes for the Impatient User
Abstract: Recently Propp and Wilson [14] have proposed an algorithm, called Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which allows not only an approximate but perfect (i.e. exact) simulation of the stationary distribution of certain finite state space Markov chains. Perfect Sampling using CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a subtle bias, the user impatience bias. Fill [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience. Fill's algorithm is a form of rejection sampling and similar to CFTP requires sufficient mono-tonicity properties of the transition kernel used. We show how Fill's version of rejection sampling can be extended to an infinite state space context to produce an exact sample of the penetrable spheres mixture process and related models. Following [5] we use Gibbs sampling and make use of the partial order of the mixture model state space. Thus"
