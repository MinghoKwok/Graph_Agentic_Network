ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 69 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210054:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_3] "Hidden Markov decision trees Abstract: We study a time series model that can be viewed as a decision tree with Markov temporal structure. The model is..."
3. [Label_3] "Abstract Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the..."
4. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
5. [Label_5] "Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on Abstract: This paper tackles the supe..."

Text to classify:
"SaxEx a case-based reasoning system for generating expressive musical performances
Abstract: We have studied the problem of generating expressive musical performances in the context of tenor saxophone interpretations. We have done several recordings of a tenor sax playing different Jazz ballads with different degrees of expressiveness including an inexpressive interpretation of each ballad. These recordings are analyzed, using SMS spectral modeling techniques, to extract information related to several expressive parameters. This set of parameters and the scores constitute the set of cases (examples) of a case-based system. From this set of cases, the system infers a set of possible expressive transformations for a given new phrase applying similarity criteria, based on background musical knowledge, between this new phrase and the set of cases. Finally, SaxEx applies the inferred expressive transformations to the new phrase using the synthesis capabilities of SMS."
