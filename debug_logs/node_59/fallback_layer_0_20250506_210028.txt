ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 59 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210028:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

4. [Label_4] "On-Line Adaptation of a Signal Predistorter through Dual Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Several researchers have demonstrated how neural networks ca..."

Text to classify:
"SELF-ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORKS FOR BLIND SEPARATION OF SOURCES
Abstract: Novel on-line learning algorithms with self adaptive learning rates (parameters) for blind separation of signals are proposed. The main motivation for development of new learning rules is to improve convergence speed and to reduce cross-talking, especially for non-stationary signals. Furthermore, we have discovered that under some conditions the proposed neural network models with associated learning algorithms exhibit a random switch of attention, i.e. they have ability of chaotic or random switching or cross-over of output signals in such way that a specified separated signal may appear at various outputs at different time windows. Validity, performance and dynamic properties of the proposed learning algorithms are investigated by computer simulation experiments."
