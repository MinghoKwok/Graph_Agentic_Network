ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 404 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214122:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"EE380L:Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition  POp Trees  under the guidance of
Abstract: Decision Trees have been widely used for classification/regression tasks. They are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks and are understandable by humans. In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree."
