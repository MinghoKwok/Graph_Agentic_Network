ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1010 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221323:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Linear Space Induction in First Order Logic with RELIEFF
Abstract: Current ILP algorithms typically use variants and extensions of the greedy search. This prevents them to detect significant relationships between the training objects. Instead of myopic impurity functions, we propose the use of the heuristic based on RELIEF for guidance of ILP algorithms. At each step, in our ILP-R system, this heuristic is used to determine a beam of candidate literals. The beam is then used in an exhaustive search for a potentially good conjunction of literals. From the efficiency point of view we introduce interesting declarative bias which enables us to keep the growth of the training set, when introducing new variables, within linear bounds (linear with respect to the clause length). This bias prohibits cross-referencing of variables in variable dependency tree. The resulting system has been tested on various artificial problems. The advantages and deficiencies of our approach are discussed."
