ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1048 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214849:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Embodiment and Manipulation Learning Process for a Humanoid Hand Abstract: nan"
2. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
3. [Label_4] "Category: Control, Navigation and Planning. Key words: Reinforcement learning, Exploration, Hidden state. Prefer oral presentation. Abstract: This pap..."
4. [Label_0] "Lazy Acquisition of Place Knowledge Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. Our framew..."
5. [Label_4] "Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models Abstract: The close connection between reinforcement learnin..."

Text to classify:
"Learning to Classify Observed Motor Behavior
Abstract: We present a representational format for observed movements The representation has a temporal structure relating components of a single complex movement. We also present OXBOW, an unsupervised learning system, which constructs classes of these movements. Empirical results indicate that the system builds abstract movement concepts with appropriate component structure allowing it to predict the latter portions of a partially observed movement."
