    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    "A DISCUSSION ON SOME DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR EFFICIENT CROSSOVER OPERATORS FOR GRAPH COLORING PROBLEMS
Abstract: A year ago, a new metaheuristic for graph coloring problems was introduced by Costa, Hertz and Dubuis. They have shown, with computer experiments, some clear indication of the benefits of this approach. Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling. The metaheuristic can be classified as a memetic algorithm since it is based on a population search in which periods of local optimization are interspersed with phases in which new configurations are created from earlier well-developed configurations or local minima of the previous iterative improvement process. The new population is created using crossover operators as in genetic algorithms. In this paper we discuss how a methodology inspired in Competitive Analysis may be relevant to the problem of designing better crossover operators. RESUMO: No ultimo ano uma nova metaheurstica para o problema de colora~c~ao em grafos foi apre-sentada por Costa, Hertz e Dubuis. Eles mostraram, com experimentos computacionais, algumas indica~c~oes claras dos benefcios desta nova tecnica. Colora~c~ao em grafos tem muitas aplica~c~oes, especialmente na area de programa~c~ao de tarefas, localiza~c~ao e horario . A metaheurstica pode ser classificada como algoritmo memetico desde que seja baseada em uma busca de popula~c~ao cujos perodos de otimiza~c~ao local s~ao intercalados com fases onde novas configura~c~oes s~ao criadas a partir de boas configura~c~oes ou mnimos locais de itera~c~oes anteriores. A nova popula~c~ao e criada usando opera~c~oes de crossover como em algoritmos geneticos. Neste artigo apresen-tamos como uma metodologia baseada em Competitive Analysis pode ser relevante para construir opera~c~oes de crossover."

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
