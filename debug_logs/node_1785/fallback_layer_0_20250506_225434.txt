ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1785 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225434:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A DISCUSSION ON SOME DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR EFFICIENT CROSSOVER OPERATORS FOR GRAPH COLORING PROBLEMS
Abstract: A year ago, a new metaheuristic for graph coloring problems was introduced by Costa, Hertz and Dubuis. They have shown, with computer experiments, some clear indication of the benefits of this approach. Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling. The metaheuristic can be classified as a memetic algorithm since it is based on a population search in which periods of local optimization are interspersed with phases in which new configurations are created from earlier well-developed configurations or local minima of the previous iterative improvement process. The new population is created using crossover operators as in genetic algorithms. In this paper we discuss how a methodology inspired in Competitive Analysis may be relevant to the problem of designing better crossover operators. RESUMO: No ultimo ano uma nova metaheurstica para o problema de colora~c~ao em grafos foi apre-sentada por Costa, Hertz e Dubuis. Eles mostraram, com experimentos computacionais, algumas indica~c~oes claras dos benefcios desta nova tecnica. Colora~c~ao em grafos tem muitas aplica~c~oes, especialmente na area de programa~c~ao de tarefas, localiza~c~ao e horario . A metaheurstica pode ser classificada como algoritmo memetico desde que seja baseada em uma busca de popula~c~ao cujos perodos de otimiza~c~ao local s~ao intercalados com fases onde novas configura~c~oes s~ao criadas a partir de boas configura~c~oes ou mnimos locais de itera~c~oes anteriores. A nova popula~c~ao e criada usando opera~c~oes de crossover como em algoritmos geneticos. Neste artigo apresen-tamos como uma metodologia baseada em Competitive Analysis pode ser relevante para construir opera~c~oes de crossover."
