ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1949 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223632:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Reformulation: Nonsmooth, Piecewise Smooth, Semismooth and Smoothing Methods, A Globally Convergent Inexact Newton Method for
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for solving systems of monotone equations which combines Newton, proximal point, and projection methodologies. An important property of the algorithm is that the whole sequence of iterates is always globally convergent to a solution of the system without any additional regularity assumptions. Moreover, under standard assumptions the local su-perlinear rate of convergence is achieved. As opposed to classical globalization strategies for Newton methods, for computing the stepsize we do not use line-search aimed at decreasing the value of some merit function. Instead, linesearch in the approximate Newton direction is used to construct an appropriate hy-perplane which separates the current iterate from the solution set. This step is followed by projecting the current iterate onto this hyperplane, which ensures global convergence of the algorithm. Computational cost of each iteration of our method is of the same order as that of the classical damped Newton method. The crucial advantage is that our method is truly globally convergent. In particular, it cannot get trapped in a stationary point of a merit function. The presented algorithm is motivated by the hybrid projection-proximal point method proposed in [25]."
