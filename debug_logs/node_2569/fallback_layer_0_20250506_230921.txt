ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2569 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230921:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The Gamma MLP Using Multiple Temporal Resolutions for Improved Classification
Abstract: We have previously introduced the Gamma MLP which is defined as an MLP with the usual synaptic weights replaced by gamma filters and associated gain terms throughout all layers. In this paper we apply the Gamma MLP to a larger scale speech phoneme recognition problem, analyze the operation of the network, and investigate why the Gamma MLP can perform better than alternatives. The Gamma MLP is capable of employing multiple temporal resolutions (the temporal resolution is defined here, as per de Vries and Principe, as the number of parameters of freedom (i.e. the number of tap variables) per unit of time in the gamma memory this is equal to the gamma memory parameter as detailed in the paper). Multiple temporal resolutions may be advantageous for certain problems, e.g. different resolutions may be optimal for extracting different features from the input data. For the problem in this paper, the Gamma MLP is observed to use a large range of temporal resolutions. In comparison, TDNN networks typically use only a single temporal resolution. Further motivation for the Gamma MLP is related to the curse of dimensionality and the ability of the Gamma MLP to trade off temporal resolution for memory depth, and therefore increase memory depth without increasing the dimensionality of the network. The IIR MLP is a more general version of the Gamma MLP however the IIR MLP performs poorly for the problem in this paper. Investigation suggests that the error surface of the Gamma MLP is more suitable for gradient descent training than the error surface of the IIR MLP."
