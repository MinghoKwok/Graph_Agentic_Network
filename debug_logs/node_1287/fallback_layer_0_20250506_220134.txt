ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1287 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220134:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Factorial Hidden Markov Models
Abstract: One of the basic probabilistic tools used for time series modeling is the hidden Markov model (HMM). In an HMM, information about the past of the time series is conveyed through a single discrete variable|the hidden state. We present a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. Both inference and learning in this model depend critically on computing the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations. We present an exact algorithm for inference in this model, and relate it to the Forward-Backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general belief networks. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or mean field theory. We also present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, based on which we derive a tractable learning algorithm. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that it outperforms HMMs in capturing the complex temporal patterns in this dataset."
