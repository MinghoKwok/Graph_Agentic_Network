ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 773 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220052:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Reinforcement Learning with Imitation in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: The application of decision making and learning algorithms to multi-agent systems presents many interestingresearch challenges and opportunities. Among these is the ability for agents to learn how to act by observing or imitating other agents. We describe an algorithm, the IQ-algorithm, that integrates imitation with Q-learning. Roughly, a Q-learner uses the observations it has made of an expert agent to bias its exploration in promising directions. This algorithm goes beyond previous work in this direction by relaxing the oft-made assumptions that the learner (observer) and the expert (observed agent) share the same objectives and abilities. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate significant transfer between agents using the IQ-model and in many cases reductions in training time."
