ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2457 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232304:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"In Proceedings of the 1997 Sian Kaan International Workshop on Neural Networks and Neurocontrol. Real-Valued
Abstract: 2 Neural Network & Machine Learning Laboratory Computer Science Department Brigham Young University Provo, UT 84602, USA Email: martinez@cs.byu.edu WWW: http://axon.cs.byu.edu Abstract. Many neural network models must be trained by finding a set of real-valued weights that yield high accuracy on a training set. Other learning models require weights on input attributes that yield high leave-one-out classification accuracy in order to avoid problems associated with irrelevant attributes and high dimensionality. In addition, there are a variety of general problems for which a set of real values must be found which maximize some evaluation function. This paper presents an algorithm for doing a schemata search over a real-valued weight space to find a set of weights (or other real values) that yield high values for a given evaluation function. The algorithm, called the Real-Valued Schemata Search (RVSS), uses the BRACE statistical technique [Moore & Lee, 1993] to determine when to narrow the search space. This paper details the RVSS approach and gives initial empirical results."
