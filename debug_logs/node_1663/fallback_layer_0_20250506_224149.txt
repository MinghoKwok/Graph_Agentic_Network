ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1663 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224149:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolution of the Topology and the Weights of Neural Networks using Genetic Programming with a
Abstract: Genetic programming is a methodology for program development, consisting of a special form of genetic algorithm capable of handling parse trees representing programs, that has been successfully applied to a variety of problems. In this paper a new approach to the construction of neural networks based on genetic programming is presented. A linear chromosome is combined to a graph representation of the network and new operators are introduced, which allow the evolution of the architecture and the weights simultaneously without the need of local weight optimization. This paper describes the approach, the operators and reports results of the application of the model to several binary classification problems."
