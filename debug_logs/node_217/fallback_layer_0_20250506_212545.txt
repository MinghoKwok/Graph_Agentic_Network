ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 217 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212545:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Scalable Performance Prediction Method for Parallel Neural Network Simulations
Abstract: A performance prediction method is presented for indicating the performance range of MIMD parallel processor systems for neural network simulations. The total execution time of a parallel application is modeled as the sum of its calculation and communication times. The method is scalable because based on the times measured on one processor and one communication link, the performance, speedup, and efficiency can be predicted for a larger processor system. It is validated quantitatively by applying it to two popular neural networks, backpropagation and the Kohonen self-organizing feature map, decomposed on a GCel-512, a 512 transputer system. Agreement of the model with the measurements is within 9%."
