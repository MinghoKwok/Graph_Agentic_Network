ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2476 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230424:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."
2. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
3. [Label_4] "Analysis of Some Incremental Variants of Policy Iteration: First Steps Toward Understanding Actor-Critic Learning Systems Abstract: Northeastern Unive..."
4. [Label_4] "Category: Control, Navigation and Planning. Key words: Reinforcement learning, Exploration, Hidden state. Prefer oral presentation. Abstract: This pap..."
5. [Label_4] "Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models Abstract: The close connection between reinforcement learnin..."

"Why Experimentation can be better than "Perfect Guidance"
Abstract: Many problems correspond to the classical control task of determining the appropriate control action to take, given some (sequence of) observations. One standard approach to learning these control rules, called behavior cloning, involves watching a perfect operator operate a plant, and then trying to emulate its behavior. In the experimental learning approach, by contrast, the learner first guesses an initial operation-to-action policy and tries it out. If this policy performs sub-optimally, the learner can modify it to produce a new policy, and recur. This paper discusses the relative effectiveness of these two approaches, especially in the presence of perceptual aliasing, showing in particular that the experimental learner can often learn more effectively than the cloning one."
