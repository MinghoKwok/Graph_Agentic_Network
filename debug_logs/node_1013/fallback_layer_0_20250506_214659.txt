ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1013 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214659:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

3. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."
4. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."

Text to classify:
"A SEQUENTIAL METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM
Abstract: This paper deals with the asymptotic properties of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, when the distribution of interest is unknown, but can be approximated by a sequential estimator of its density. We prove that, under very simple conditions, the rate of convergence of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is the same as that of the sequential estimator when the latter is introduced as the reversible measure for the Metropolis-Hastings Kernel. This problem is a natural extension of previous a work on a new simulated annealing algorithm with a sequential estimator of the energy."
