ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2622 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233105:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Feature Selection by Means of a Feature Weighting Approach
Abstract: Selecting a set of features which is optimal for a given classification task is one of the central problems in machine learning. We address the problem using the flexible and robust filter technique EUBAFES. EUBAFES is based on a feature weighting approach which computes binary feature weights and therefore a solution in the feature selection sense and also gives detailed information about feature relevance by continuous weights. Moreover the user gets not only one but several potentially optimal feature subsets which is important for filter-based feature selection algorithms since it gives the flexibility to use even complex classifiers by the application of a combined filter/wrapper approach. We applied EUBAFES on a number of artificial and real world data sets and used radial basis function networks to examine the impact of the feature subsets to classifier accuracy and complexity."
