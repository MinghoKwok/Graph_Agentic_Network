ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2544 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233322:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Choosing Learning Strategies to Achieve Learning Goals
Abstract: In open world applications a number of machine-learning techniques may potentially apply to a given learning situation. The research presented here illustrates the complexity involved in automatically choosing an appropriate technique in a multistrategy learning system. It also constitutes a step toward a general computational solution to the learning-strategy selection problem. The approach is to treat learning-strategy selection as a separate planning problem with its own set of goals, as is the case with ordinary problem-solvers. Therefore, the management and pursuit of these learning goals becomes a central issue in learning, similar to the goal-management problems associated with traditional planning systems. This paper explores some issues, problems, and possible solutions in such a framework. Examples are presented from a multistrategy learning system called Meta-AQUA."
