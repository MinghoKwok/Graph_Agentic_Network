ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1023 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220815:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Data Reconciliation and Gross Error Detection for Dynamic Systems
Abstract: Gross error detection plays a vital role in parameter estimation and data reconciliation for both dynamic and steady state systems. In particular, recent advances in process optimization now allow data reconciliation of dynamic systems and appropriate problem formulations need to be considered for them. Data errors due to either miscalibrated or faulty sensors or just random events nonrepresentative of the underlying statistical distribution, can induce heavy biases in the parameter estimates and in the reconciled data. In this paper we concentrate on robust estimators and exploratory statistical methods which allow us to detect the gross errors as the data reconciliation is performed. These robust methods have the property of being insensitive to departures from ideal statistical distributions and therefore are insensitive to the presence of outliers. Once the regression is done, the outliers can be detected readily by using exploratory statistical techniques. An important feature for performance of the optimization algorithm and uniqueness of the reconciled data is the ability to classify the variables according to their observability and redundancy properties. Here an observable variable is an unmeasured quantity which can be estimated from the measured variables through the physical model while a nonredundant variable is a measured variable which cannot be estimated other than through its measurements. Variable classification can be used as an aid to design instrumentation schemes. In this"
