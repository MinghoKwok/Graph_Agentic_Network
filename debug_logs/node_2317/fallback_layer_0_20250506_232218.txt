ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2317 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232218:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Cellular Encoding Applied to Neurocontrol
Abstract: Neural networks are trained for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. For one variant of the single pole system, only pole angle and cart position variables are supplied as inputs; the network must learn to compute velocities. All of the problems are solved using a fixed architecture and using a new version of cellular encoding that evolves an application specific architecture with real-valued weights. The learning times and generalization capabilities are compared for neural networks developed using both methods. After a post processing simplification, topologies produced by cellular encoding were very simple and could be analyzed. Architectures with no hidden units were produced for the single pole and the two pole problem when velocity information is supplied as an input. Moreover, these linear solutions display good generalization. For all the control problems, cellular encoding can automatically generate architectures whose complexity and structure reflect the features of the problem to solve."
