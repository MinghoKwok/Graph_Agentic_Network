ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2510 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230613:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_3] "On the Markov Equivalence of Chain Graphs, Undirected Graphs, and Acyclic Digraphs Abstract: Graphical Markov models use undirected graphs (UDGs), acy..."
3. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."
4. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
5. [Label_3] "Hidden Markov decision trees Abstract: We study a time series model that can be viewed as a decision tree with Markov temporal structure. The model is..."

Text to classify:
"Geometric Ergodicity and Hybrid Markov Chains
Abstract: Various notions of geometric ergodicity for Markov chains on general state spaces exist. In this paper, we review certain relations and implications among them. We then apply these results to a collection of chains commonly used in Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, the so-called hybrid chains. We prove that under certain conditions, a hybrid chain will "inherit" the geometric ergodicity of its constituent parts. Acknowledgements.
