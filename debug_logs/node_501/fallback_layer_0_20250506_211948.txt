ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 501 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211948:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Some Biases for Efficient Learning of Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-Temporal Patterns
Abstract: This paper introduces and explores some representational biases for efficient learning of spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns in connectionist networks (CN) massively parallel networks of simple computing elements. It examines learning mechanisms that constructively build up network structures that encode information from environmental stimuli at successively higher resolutions as needed for the tasks (e.g., perceptual recognition) that the network has to perform. Some simple examples are presented to illustrate the the basic structures and processes used in such networks to ensure the parsimony of learned representations by guiding the system to focus its efforts at the minimal adequate resolution. Several extensions of the basic algorithm for efficient learning using multi-resolution representations of spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns are discussed."
