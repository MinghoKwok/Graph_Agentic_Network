ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1385 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223314:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning Control Knowledge in Models of Expertise ECML'95 Workshop on Knowledge-Level Modelling and Machine Learning
Abstract: During the development and the life-cycle of knowledge-based systems the requirements on the system and the knowledge in the system will change. One of the types of knowledge affected by changing requirements is control-knowledge, which prescribes the ordering of problem-solving steps. Machine-learning can aid developers of knowledge-based systems in adapting their systems to changing requirements. A number of machine-learning techniques for learning control-knowledge have been applied to problem-solvers (Prodigy-EBL, LEX). In knowledge engineering, the focus has shifted to the construction of knowledge-level models of problem-solving instead of directly constructing a knowledge-based system in a problem-solver. In this paper we describe work in progress on how to apply machine learning techniques to the KADS model of expertise."
