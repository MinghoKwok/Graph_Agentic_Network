ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1786 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224818:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Decision Trees: Equivalence and Propositional Operations
Abstract: For the well-known concept of decision trees as it is used for inductive inference we study the natural concept of equivalence: two decision trees are equivalent if and only if they represent the same hypothesis. We present a simple efficient algorithm to establish whether two decision trees are equivalent or not. The complexity of this algorithm is bounded by the product of the sizes of both decision trees. The hypothesis represented by a decision tree is essentially a boolean function, just like a proposition. Although every boolean function can be represented in this way, we show that disjunctions and conjunctions of decision trees can not efficiently be represented as decision trees, and simply shaped propositions may require exponential size for representation as de cision trees."
