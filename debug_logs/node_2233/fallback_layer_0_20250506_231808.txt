ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2233 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231808:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"An unsupervised neural network for low-level control of a wheeled mobile robot: noise resistance, stability,
Abstract: We have recently introduced a neural network mobile robot controller (NETMORC) that autonomously learns the forward and inverse odometry of a differential drive robot through an unsupervised learning-by-doing cycle. After an initial learning phase, the controller can move the robot to an arbitrary stationary or moving target while compensating for noise and other forms of disturbance, such as wheel slippage or changes in the robot's plant. In addition, the forward odometric map allows the robot to reach targets in the absence of sensory feedback. The controller is also able to adapt in response to long-term changes in the robot's plant, such as a change in the radius of the wheels. In this article we review the NETMORC architecture and describe its simplified algorithmic implementation, we present new, quantitative results on NETMORC's performance and adaptability under noise-free and noisy conditions, we compare NETMORC's performance on a trajectory-following task with the performance of an alternative controller, and we describe preliminary results on the hardware implementation of NETMORC with the mobile robot ROBUTER."
