ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 308 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213618:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_2: 1 examples
- Label_5: 2 examples
- Label_6: 8 examples

Text to classify:
"The Power of Self-Directed Learning
Abstract: This paper studies self-directed learning, a variant of the on-line learning model in which the learner selects the presentation order for the instances. We give tight bounds on the complexity of self-directed learning for the concept classes of monomials, k-term DNF formulas, and orthogonal rectangles in f0; 1; ; n1g d . These results demonstrate that the number of mistakes under self-directed learning can be surprisingly small. We then prove that the model of self-directed learning is more powerful than all other commonly used on-line and query learning models. Next we explore the relationship between the complexity of self-directed learning and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Finally, we explore a relationship between Mitchell's version space algorithm and the existence of self-directed learning algorithms that make few mistakes. fl Supported in part by a GE Foundation Junior Faculty Grant and NSF Grant CCR-9110108.
