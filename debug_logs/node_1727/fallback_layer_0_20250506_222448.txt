ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1727 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222448:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_4] "Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of TD() for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) methods constit..."
2. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
3. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
4. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
5. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"Machine Learning, 22(1/2/3):95-121, 1996. On the Worst-case Analysis of Temporal-difference Learning Algorithms
Abstract: We study the behavior of a family of learning algorithms based on Sutton's method of temporal differences. In our on-line learning framework, learning takes place in a sequence of trials, and the goal of the learning algorithm is to estimate a discounted sum of all the reinforcements that will be received in the future. In this setting, we are able to prove general upper bounds on the performance of a slightly modified version of Sutton's so-called TD() algorithm. These bounds are stated in terms of the performance of the best linear predictor on the given training sequence, and are proved without making any statistical assumptions of any kind about the process producing the learner's observed training sequence. We also prove lower bounds on the performance of any algorithm for this learning problem, and give a similar analysis of the closely related problem of learning to predict in a model in which the learner must produce predictions for a whole batch of observations before receiving reinforcement."
