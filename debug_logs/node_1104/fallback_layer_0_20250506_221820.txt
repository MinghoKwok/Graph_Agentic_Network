ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1104 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221820:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Feature Generation for Sequence Categorization
Abstract: The problem of sequence categorization is to generalize from a corpus of labeled sequences procedures for accurately labeling future unlabeled sequences. The choice of representation of sequences can have a major impact on this task, and in the absence of background knowledge a good representation is often not known and straightforward representations are often far from optimal. We propose a feature generation method (called FGEN) that creates Boolean features that check for the presence or absence of heuristically selected collections of subsequences. We show empirically that the representation computed by FGEN improves the accuracy of two commonly used learning systems (C4.5 and Ripper) when the new features are added to existing representations of sequence data. We show the superiority of FGEN across a range of tasks selected from three domains: DNA sequences, Unix command sequences, and English text."
