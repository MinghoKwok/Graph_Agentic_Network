ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 866 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213910:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Analyzing Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Self-Organizing Maps
Abstract: The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a widely used algorithm for the unsupervised learning of neural maps, can be formulated in a low-dimensional "feature map" variant which requires prespecified parameters ("features") for the description of receptive fields, or in a more general high-dimensional variant which allows to self-organize the structure of individual receptive fields as well as their arrangement in a map. We present here a new analytical method to derive conditions for the emergence of structure in SOMs which is particularly suited for the as yet inaccessible high-dimensional SOM variant. Our approach is based on an evaluation of a map distortion function. It involves only an ansatz for the way stimuli are distributed among map neurons; the receptive fields of the map need not be known explicitely. Using this method we first calculate regions of stability for four possible states of SOMs projecting from a rectangular input space to a ring of neurons. We then analyze the transition from non-oriented to oriented receptive fields in a SOM-based model for the development of orientation maps. In both cases, the analytical results are well corroborated by the results of computer simulations. submitted to Biological Cybernetics, December 14, 1995 revised version, July 14, 1996"
