ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2263 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231936:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_0: 4 examples
- Label_3: 1 examples
- Label_5: 3 examples
- Label_6: 3 examples

Memory:

2. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."
3. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."
4. [Label_0] "Context-Sensitive Feature Selection for Lazy Learners Abstract:"

Text to classify:
"A Connectionist Architecture for Learning to Parse
Abstract: We present a connectionist architecture and demonstrate that it can learn syntactic parsing from a corpus of parsed text. The architecture can represent syntactic constituents, and can learn generalizations over syntactic constituents, thereby addressing the sparse data problems of previous connectionist architectures. We apply these Simple Synchrony Networks to mapping sequences of word tags to parse trees. After training on parsed samples of the Brown Corpus, the networks achieve precision and recall on constituents that approaches that of statistical methods for this task."
