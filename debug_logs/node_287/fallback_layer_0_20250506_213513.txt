ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 287 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213513:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning Switching Concepts
Abstract: We consider learning in situations where the function used to classify examples may switch back and forth between a small number of different concepts during the course of learning. We examine several models for such situations: oblivious models in which switches are made independent of the selection of examples, and more adversarial models in which a single adversary controls both the concept switches and example selection. We show relationships between the more benign models and the p-concepts of Kearns and Schapire, and present polynomial-time algorithms for learning switches between two k-DNF formulas. For the most adversarial model, we present a model of success patterned after the popular competitive analysis used in studying on-line algorithms. We describe a randomized query algorithm for such adversarial switches between two monotone disjunctions that is "1-competitive" in that the total number of mistakes plus queries is with high probability bounded by the number of switches plus some fixed polynomial in n (the number of variables). We also use notions described here to provide sufficient conditions under which learning a p-concept class "with a decision rule" implies being able to learn the class "with a model of probability.""
