ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1184 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221640:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Causality in Genetic Programming
Abstract: Causality relates changes in the structure of an object with the effects of such changes, that is changes in the properties or behavior of the object. This paper analyzes the concept of causality in Genetic Programming (GP) and suggests how it can be used in adapting control parameters for speeding up GP search. We first analyze the effects of crossover to show the weak causality of the GP representation and operators. Hierarchical GP approaches based on the discovery and evolution of functions amplify this phenomenon. However, selection gradually retains strongly causal changes. Causality is correlated to search space exploitation and is discussed in the context of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The results described argue for a bottom-up GP evolutionary thesis. Finally, new developments based on the idea of GP architecture evolution (Koza, 1994a) are discussed from the causality perspective."
