ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1187 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215614:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
2. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."
4. [Label_4] "Embodiment and Manipulation Learning Process for a Humanoid Hand Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."

Text to classify:
"nan
