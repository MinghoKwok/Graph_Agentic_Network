ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 590 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215113:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"APPROXIMATION IN L p (R d FROM SPACES SPANNED BY THE PERTURBED INTEGER TRANSLATES OF
Abstract: May 14, 1995 Abstract. The problem of approximating smooth L p -functions from spaces spanned by the integer translates of a radially symmetric function is very well understood. In case the points of translation, ffi, are scattered throughout R d , the approximation problem is only well understood in the "stationary" setting. In this work, we treat the "non-stationary" setting under the assumption that ffi is a small perturbation of Z d . Our results, which are similar in many respects to the known results for the case ffi = Z d , apply specifically to the examples of the Gauss kernel and the Generalized Multiquadric."
