ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 220 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212554:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning sorting and decision trees with POMDPs
Abstract: pomdps are general models of sequential decisions in which both actions and observations can be probabilistic. Many problems of interest can be formulated as pomdps, yet the use of pomdps has been limited by the lack of effective algorithms. Recently this has started to change and a number of problems such as robot navigation and planning are beginning to be formulated and solved as pomdps. The advantage of the pomdp approach is its clean semantics and its ability to produce principled solutions that integrate physical and information gathering actions. In this paper we pursue this approach in the context of two learning tasks: learning to sort a vector of numbers and learning decision trees from data. Both problems are formulated as pomdps and solved by a general pomdp algorithm. The main lessons and results are that 1) the use of suitable heuristics and representations allows for the solution of sorting and classification pomdps of non-trivial sizes, 2) the quality of the resulting solutions are competitive with the best algorithms, and 3) problematic aspects in decision tree learning such as test and mis-classification costs, noisy tests, and missing values are naturally accommodated."
