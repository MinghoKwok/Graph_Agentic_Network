ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 504 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214050:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"MANIAC: A Next Generation Neurally Based Autonomous Road Follower
Abstract: The use of artificial neural networks in the domain of autonomous vehicle navigation has produced promising results. ALVINN [Pomerleau, 1991] has shown that a neural system can drive a vehicle reliably and safely on many different types of roads, ranging from paved paths to interstate highways. Even with these impressive results, several areas within the neural paradigm for autonomous road following still need to be addressed. These include transparent navigation between roads of different type, simultaneous use of different sensors, and generalization to road types which the neural system has never seen. The system presented here addresses these issue with a modular neural architecture which uses pre-trained ALVINN networks and a connectionist superstructure to robustly drive on many dif ferent types of roads."
