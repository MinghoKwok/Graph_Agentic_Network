ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 232 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213219:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Stochastic Decomposition of DNA Sequences Using Hidden Markov Models
Abstract: This work presents an application of a machine learning for characterizing an important property of natural DNA sequences compositional inhomogeneity. Compositional segments often correspond to meaningful biological units. Taking into account such inhomogeneity is a prerequisite of successful recognition of functional features in DNA sequences, especially, protein-coding genes. Here we present a technique for DNA segmentation using hidden Markov models. A DNA sequence is represented by a chain of homogeneous segments, each described by one of a few statistically discriminated hidden states, whose contents form a first-order Markov chain. The technique is used to describe and compare chromosomes I and IV of the completely sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) genome. Our results indicate the existence of a few well separated states, which gives support to the isochore theory. We also explore the model's likelihood landscape and analyze the dynamics of the optimization process, thus addressing the problem of reliability of the obtained optima and efficiency of the algorithms."
