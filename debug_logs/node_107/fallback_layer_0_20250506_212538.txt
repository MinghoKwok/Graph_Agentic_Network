ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 107 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212538:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_2: 2 examples
- Label_3: 6 examples
- Label_6: 2 examples

Memory:
1. [Label_3] "Robustness Analysis of Bayesian Networks with Global Neighborhoods Abstract: This paper presents algorithms for robustness analysis of Bayesian networ..."
2. [Label_3] "Logarithmic Time Parallel Bayesian Inference Abstract: I present a parallel algorithm for exact probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. For poly..."
3. [Label_3] "Algebraic Techniques for Efficient Inference in Bayesian Networks Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic ..."
4. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."

Text to classify:
"Computing upper and lower bounds on likelihoods in intractable networks
Abstract: We present deterministic techniques for computing upper and lower bounds on marginal probabilities in sigmoid and noisy-OR networks. These techniques become useful when the size of the network (or clique size) precludes exact computations. We illustrate the tightness of the bounds by numerical experi ments."
