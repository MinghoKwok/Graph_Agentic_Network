ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1829 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223010:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On the Connection Between Stochastic Smoothing, Filtering and Estimation with Incomplete Data
Abstract: Connections between stochastic smoothing/filtering and estimation with incomplete data are investigated. It is shown, under the right censoring scheme, that the Kaplan-Meier estimator can be characterized as a moment estimate based on a stochastic filter/smoother(a pseudo-filter/smoother). Motivated by this result, a potentially useful martingale approach for estimation and convergence with incomplete data is proposed: estimators are characterized as pseudo-stochastic smoothers (which sometimes reduce to filters), which are described by a (system of) stochastic integral equation(s); recent results in convergence of stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations are then applied to address convergence issues. As an illustration, the double censoring problem is revisited under this framework, a closed form estimator is proposed and convergence properties studied. Martingale theory plays a vital role in the entire analysis. This approach is in essence a self-consistency method. 1"
