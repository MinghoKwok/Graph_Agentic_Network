ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1677 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224234:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"ICSIM: An Object Oriented Simulation Environment for Structured Connectionist Nets. Class Project Report, Physics 250
Abstract: ICSIM is a simulator for structured connectionism under development at ICSI. Structured connectionism is characterized by the need for flexibility, efficiency and support for the design and reuse of modular substructure. We take the position that a fast object-oriented language like Sather [5] is an appropriate implementation medium to achieve these goals. The core of ICSIM consists of a hierarchy of classes that correspond to simulation entities. New connectionist models are realized by combining and specializing pre-existing classes. Whenever possible, auxillary functionality has been separated out into functional modules in order to keep the basic hierarchy as clean and simple as possible."
