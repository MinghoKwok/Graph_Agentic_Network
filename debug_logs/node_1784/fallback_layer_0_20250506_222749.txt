ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1784 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222749:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Genetic Programming and Redundancy
Abstract: The Genetic Programming optimization method (GP) elaborated by John Koza [ Koza, 1992 ] is a variant of Genetic Algorithms. The search space of the problem domain consists of computer programs represented as parse trees, and the crossover operator is realized by an exchange of subtrees. Empirical analyses show that large parts of those trees are never used or evaluated which means that these parts of the trees are irrelevant for the solution or redundant. This paper is concerned with the identification of the redundancy occuring in GP. It starts with a mathematical description of the behavior of GP and the conclusions drawn from that description among others explain the "size problem" which denotes the phenomenon that the average size of trees in the population grows with time."
