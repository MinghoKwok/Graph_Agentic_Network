ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2212 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225021:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"ANALYSIS OF SOUND TEXTURES IN MUSICAL AND MACHINE SOUNDS BY MEANS OF HIGHER ORDER STATISTICAL FEATURES.
Abstract: In this paper we describe a sound classification method, which seems to be applicable to a broad domain of stationary, non-musical sounds, such as machine noises and other man made non periodic sounds. The method is based on matching higher order spectra (HOS) of the acoustic signals and it generalizes our earlier results on classification of sustained musical sounds by higher order statistics. An efficient "decorrelated matched filter" implemetation is presented. The results show good sound classification statistics and a comparison to spectral matching methods is also discussed."
