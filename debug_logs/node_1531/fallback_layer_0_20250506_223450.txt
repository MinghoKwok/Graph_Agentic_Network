ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1531 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223450:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"NACODAE: Navy Conversational Decision Aids Environment
Abstract: This report documents NACODAE, the Navy Conversational Decision Aids Environment being developed at the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence (NCARAI), which is a branch of the Naval Research Laboratory. NA-CODAE is a software prototype that is being developed under the Practical Advances in Case-Based Reasoning project, which is funded by the Office for Naval Research, for the purpose of assisting Navy and other DoD personnel in decision aids tasks such as system maintenance, operational training, crisis response planning, logistics, fault diagnosis, target classification, and meteorological nowcasting. Implemented in Java, NACODAE can be used on any machine containing a Java virtual machine (e.g., PCs, Unix). This document describes and exemplifies NACODAE's capabilities. Our goal is to transition this tool to operational personnel, and to continue its enhancement through user feedback and by testing recent research advances in case-based reasoning and related areas."
