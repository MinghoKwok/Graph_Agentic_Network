ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1389 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223326:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Support Vector Machines: Training and Applications
Abstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new and very promising classification technique developed by Vapnik and his group at AT&T Bell Laboratories [3, 6, 8, 24]. This new learning algorithm can be seen as an alternative training technique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. The main idea behind the technique is to separate the classes with a surface that maximizes the margin between them. An interesting property of this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle [23]. The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its relationship with SRM, and its geometrical insight, are discussed in this paper. Since Structural Risk Minimization is an inductive principle that aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model, rather than minimizing the Mean Square Error over the data set (as Empirical Risk Minimization methods do), training a SVM to obtain the maximum margin classifier requires a different objective function. This objective function is then optimized by solving a large-scale quadratic programming problem with linear and box constraints. The problem is considered challenging, because the quadratic form is completely dense, so the memory needed to store the problem grows with the square of the number of data points. Therefore, training problems arising in some real applications with large data sets are impossible to load into memory, and cannot be solved using standard non-linear constrained optimization algorithms. We present a decomposition algorithm that can be used to train SVM's over large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present previous approaches, as well as results and important details of our implementation of the algorithm using a second-order variant of the Reduced Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems. As an application of SVM's, we present preliminary results in Frontal Human Face Detection in images. This application opens many interesting questions and future research opportunities, both in the context of faster and better optimization algorithms, and in the use of SVM's in other pattern classification, recognition, and detection applications.
