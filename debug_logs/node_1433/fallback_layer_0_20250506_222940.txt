ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1433 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222940:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning Boxes in High Dimension
Abstract: We present exact learning algorithms that learn several classes of (discrete) boxes in f0; : : :; ` 1g n . In particular we learn: (1) The class of unions of O(log n) boxes in time poly(n; log `) (solving an open problem of [16, 12]; in [3] this class is shown to be learnable in time poly(n; `)). (2) The class of unions of disjoint boxes in time poly(n; t; log `), where t is the number of boxes. (Previously this was known only in the case where all boxes are disjoint in one of the dimensions; in [3] this class is shown to be learnable in time poly(n; t; `)). In particular our algorithm learns the class of decision trees over n variables, that take values in f0; : : :; ` 1g, with comparison nodes in time poly(n; t; log `), where t is the number of leaves (this was an open problem in [9] which was shown in [4] to be learnable in time poly(n; t; `)). (3) The class of unions of O(1)-degenerate boxes (that is, boxes that depend only on O(1) variables) in time poly(n; t; log `) (generalizing the learnability of O(1)-DNF and of boxes in O(1) dimensions). The algorithm for this class uses only equivalence queries and it can also be used to learn the class of unions of O(1) boxes (from equivalence queries only). fl A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the EuroCOLT '97 conference, published in volume 1208 of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, pages 3-15. Springer-Verlag, 1997."
