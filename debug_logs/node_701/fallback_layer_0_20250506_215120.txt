ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 701 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215120:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Experiments on the Transfer of Knowledge between Neural Networks Reprinted from: Computational Learning Theory and
Abstract: This chapter describes three studies which address the question of how neural network learning can be improved via the incorporation of information extracted from other networks. This general problem, which we call network transfer, encompasses many types of relationships between source and target networks. Our focus is on the utilization of weights from source networks which solve a subproblem of the target network task, with the goal of speeding up learning on the target task. We demonstrate how the approach described here can improve learning speed by up to ten times over learning starting with random weights."
