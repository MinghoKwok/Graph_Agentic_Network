ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 385 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214023:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Modeling the Student with Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: We describe a methodology for enabling an intelligent teaching system to make high level strategy decisions on the basis of low level student modeling information. This framework is less costly to construct, and superior to hand coding teaching strategies as it is more responsive to the learner's needs. In order to accomplish this, reinforcement learning is used to learn to associate superior teaching actions with certain states of the student's knowledge. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to be flexible in handling noisy data, and does not need expert domain knowledge. A drawback of RL is that it often needs a significant number of trials for learning. We propose an off-line learning methodology using sample data, simulated students, and small amounts of expert knowledge to bypass this problem."
