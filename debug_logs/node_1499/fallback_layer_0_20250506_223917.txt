ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1499 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223917:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Comparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers
Abstract: The Support Vector (SV) machine is a novel type of learning machine, based on statistical learning theory, which contains polynomial classifiers, neural networks, and radial basis function (RBF) networks as special cases. In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights and threshold such as to minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by k-means clustering and the weights are found using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the US postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest test accuracy, followed by the hybrid approach. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded, but also superior in a practical application. This report describes research done at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and at AT&T Bell Laboratories (now AT&T Research, and Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories). Support for the Center is provided in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation under contract ASC-9217041. BS thanks the M.I.T. for hospitality during a three-week visit in March 1995, where this work was started. At the time of the study, BS, CB, and VV were with AT&T Bell Laboratories, NJ; KS, FG, PN, and TP were with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. KS is now with the Department of Information Systems and Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 0511; CB and PN are with Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, NJ; VV is with AT&T Research, NJ.
