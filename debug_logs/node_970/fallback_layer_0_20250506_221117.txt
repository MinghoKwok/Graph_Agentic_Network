ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 970 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221117:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_1: 8 examples
- Label_4: 3 examples

"Generality versus Size in Genetic Programming
Abstract: Genetic Programming (GP) uses variable size representations as programs. Size becomes an important and interesting emergent property of the structures evolved by GP. The size of programs can be both a controlling and a controlled factor in GP search. Size influences the efficiency of the search process and is related to the generality of solutions. This paper analyzes the size and generality issues in standard GP and GP using subroutines and addresses the question whether such an analysis can help control the search process. We relate the size, generalization and modularity issues for programs evolved to control an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment, as exemplified by the Pac-Man game."
