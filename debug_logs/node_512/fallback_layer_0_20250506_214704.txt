ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 512 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214704:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

Text to classify:
"Fault-Tolerant Implementation of Finite-State Automata in Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract: Recently, we have proven that the dynamics of any deterministic finite-state automata (DFA) with n states and m input symbols can be implemented in a sparse second-order recurrent neural network (SORNN) with n + 1 state neurons and O(mn) second-order weights and sigmoidal discriminant functions [5]. We investigate how that constructive algorithm can be extended to fault-tolerant neural DFA implementations where faults in an analog implementation of neurons or weights do not affect the desired network performance. We show that tolerance to weight perturbation can be achieved easily; tolerance to weight and/or neuron stuck-at-zero faults, however, requires duplication of the network resources. This result has an impact on the construction of neural DFAs with a dense internal representation of DFA states."
