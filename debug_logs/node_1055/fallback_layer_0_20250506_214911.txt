ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1055 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214911:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_3] "Maximum Likelihood and Covariant Algorithms for Independent Component Analysis somewhat more biologically plausible, involving no Abstract: Bell and S..."
2. [Label_2] "Optimal Alignments in Linear Space using Automaton-derived Cost Functions (Extended Abstract) Submitted to CPM'96 Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95]..."
3. [Label_6] "The Weighted Majority Algorithm Abstract: fl This research was primarily conducted while this author was at the University of Calif. at Santa Cruz wit..."
4. [Label_5] "Incremental Reduced Error Pruning Abstract: This paper outlines some problems that may occur with Reduced Error Pruning in relational learning algorit..."
5. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."

Text to classify:
"Parsimonious Least Norm Approximation
Abstract: A theoretically justifiable fast finite successive linear approximation algorithm is proposed for obtaining a parsimonious solution to a corrupted linear system Ax = b + p, where the corruption p is due to noise or error in measurement. The proposed linear-programming-based algorithm finds a solution x by parametrically minimizing the number of nonzero elements in x and the error k Ax b p k 1 . Numerical tests on a signal-processing-based example indicate that the proposed method is comparable to a method that parametrically minimizes the 1-norm of the solution x and the error k Ax b p k 1 , and that both methods are superior, by orders of magnitude, to solutions obtained by least squares as well by combinatorially choosing an optimal solution with a specific number of nonzero elements."
