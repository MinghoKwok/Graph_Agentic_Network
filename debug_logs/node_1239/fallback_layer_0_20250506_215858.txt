ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1239 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215858:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Hidden Markov Modeling of simultaneously recorded cells in the Associative cortex of behaving monkeys
Abstract: A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the cell-assembly hypothesis suggested by Hebb in 1949. According to this hypothesis, the basic unit of information processing in the brain is an assembly of cells, which can act briefly as a closed system, in response to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a Hidden Markov Model. This model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity of behavioral processes. In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioral mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependency of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of activity and not on local connectivity alone."
