ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1058 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214921:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than sin..."
2. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
3. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
4. [Label_2] "MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T..."
5. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."

Text to classify:
"Statistical Theory of Overtraining Is Cross-Validation Asymptotically Effective?
Abstract: A statistical theory for overtraining is proposed. The analysis treats realizable stochastic neural networks, trained with Kullback-Leibler loss in the asymptotic case. It is shown that the asymptotic gain in the generalization error is small if we perform early stopping, even if we have access to the optimal stopping time. Considering cross-validation stopping we answer the question: In what ratio the examples should be divided into training and testing sets in order to obtain the optimum performance. In the non-asymptotic region cross-validated early stopping always decreases the generalization error. Our large scale simulations done on a CM5 are in nice agreement with our analytical findings."
