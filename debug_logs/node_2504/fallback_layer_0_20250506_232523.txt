ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2504 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232523:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Genetic Encoding Strategies for Neural Networks
Abstract: The application of genetic algorithms to neural network optimization (GANN) has produced an active field of research. This paper proposes a classification of the encoding strategies and it also gives a critical analysis of the current state of development. The idea of evolving artificial neural networks (NN) by genetic algorithms (GA) is based on a powerful metaphor: the evolution of the human brain. This mechanism has developed the highest form of intelligence known from scratch. The metaphor has inspired a great deal of research activities that can be traced to the late 1980s (for instance [15]). An increasing amount of research reports, journal papers and theses have been published on the topic, generating a conti-nously growing field. Researchers have devoloped a variety of different techniques to encode neural networks for the GA, with increasing complexity. This young field is driven mostly by small, independet research groups that scarcely cooperate with each other. This paper will attempt to analyse and to structure the already performed work, and to point out the shortcomings of the approaches."
