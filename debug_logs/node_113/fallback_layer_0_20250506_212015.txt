ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 113 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212015:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"LU TP  Pattern Discrimination Using Feed-Forward Networks a Benchmark Study of Scaling Behaviour
Abstract: The discrimination powers of Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ) networks are compared for overlapping Gaussian distributions. It is shown, both analytically and with Monte Carlo studies, that the MLP network handles high dimensional problems in a more efficient way than LVQ. This is mainly due to the sigmoidal form of the MLP transfer function, but also to the the fact that the MLP uses hyper-planes more efficiently. Both algorithms are equally robust to limited training sets and the learning curves fall off like 1=M, where M is the training set size, which is compared to theoretical predictions from statistical estimates and Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds."
