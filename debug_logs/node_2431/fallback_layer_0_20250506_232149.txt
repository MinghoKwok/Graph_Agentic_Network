ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2431 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232149:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Multi-class problems and discretization in ICL Extended abstract
Abstract: Handling multi-class problems and real numbers is important in practical applications of machine learning to KDD problems. While attribute-value learners address these problems as a rule, very few ILP systems do so. The few ILP systems that handle real numbers mostly do so by trying out all real values that are applicable, thus running into efficiency or overfitting problems. This paper discusses some recent extensions of ICL that address these problems. ICL, which stands for Inductive Constraint Logic, is an ILP system that learns first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples. The main charateristic of ICL is its view on examples. These are seen as interpretations which are true or false for the clausal target theory (in CNF). We first argue that ICL can be used for learning a theory in a disjunctive normal form (DNF). With this in mind, a possible solution for handling more than two classes is given (based on some ideas from CN2). Finally, we show how to tackle problems with continuous values by adapting discretization techniques from attribute value learners."
