ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 333 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211201:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Comparison of Action Selection Learning Methods
Abstract: Our goal is to develop a hybrid cognitive model of how humans acquire skills on complex cognitive tasks. We are pursuing this goal by designing hybrid computational architectures for the NRL Navigation task, which requires competent senso-rimotor coordination. In this paper, we empirically compare two methods for control knowledge acquisition (reinforcement learning and a novel variant of action models), as well as a hybrid of these methods, with human learning on this task. Our results indicate that the performance of our action models approach more closely approximates the rate of human learning on the task than does reinforcement learning or the hybrid. We also experimentally explore the impact of background knowledge on system performance. By adding knowledge used by the action models system to the benchmark reinforcement learner, we elevate its performance above that of the action models system."
