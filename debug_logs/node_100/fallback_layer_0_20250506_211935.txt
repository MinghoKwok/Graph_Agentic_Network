ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 100 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211935:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Using Markov Chains to Analyze GAFOs
Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of the properties of genetic algorithms (GAs) being used for function optimization (GAFOs) is not as strong as we would like. Traditional schema analysis provides some first order insights, but doesn't capture the non-linear dynamics of the GA search process very well. Markov chain theory has been used primarily for steady state analysis of GAs. In this paper we explore the use of transient Markov chain analysis to model and understand the behavior of finite population GAFOs observed while in transition to steady states. This approach appears to provide new insights into the circumstances under which GAFOs will (will not) perform well. Some preliminary results are presented and an initial evaluation of the merits of this approach is provided."
