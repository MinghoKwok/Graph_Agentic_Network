ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1222 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221839:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Towards a General Distributed Platform for Learning and Generalization and Word Perfect Corp. 1 Introduction
Abstract: Different learning models employ different styles of generalization on novel inputs. This paper proposes the need for multiple styles of generalization to support a broad application base. The Priority ASOCS model (Priority Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System) is overviewed and presented as a potential platform which can support multiple generalization styles. PASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. The PASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During data processing mode, the system acts as a parallel hardware circuit. During learning mode, the PASOCS incorporates rules, with attached priorities, which represent the application being learned. Learning is accomplished in a distributed fashion in time logarithmic in the number of rules. The new model has significant learning time and space complexity improvements over previous models. Generalization in a learning system is at best always a guess. The proper style of generalization is application dependent. Thus, one style of generalization may not be sufficient to allow a learning system to support a broad spectrum of applications [14]. Current connectionist models use one specific style of generalization which is implicit in the learning algorithm. We suggest that the type of generalization used be a self-organizing parameter of the learning system which can be discovered as learning takes place. This requires a) a model which allows flexible generalization styles, and b) mechanisms to guide the system into the best style of generalization for the problem being learned. This paper overviews a learning model which seeks to efficiently support requirement a) above. The model is called Priority ASOCS (PASOCS) [9], which is a member of a class of models called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) [5]. Section 2 of this paper gives an example of how different generalization techniques can approach a problem. Section 3 presents an overview of PASOCS. Section 4 illustrates how flexible generalization can be supported. Section 5 concludes the paper."
