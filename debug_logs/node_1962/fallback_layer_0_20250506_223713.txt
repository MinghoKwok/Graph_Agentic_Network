ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1962 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223713:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "A Statistical Approach to Solving the EBL Utility Problem Abstract: Many "learning from experience" systems use information extracted from problem sol..."
2. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
3. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
4. [Label_3] "Discovering Structure in Continuous Variables Using Bayesian Networks Abstract: We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using nonlinear co..."
5. [Label_3] "Algebraic Techniques for Efficient Inference in Bayesian Networks Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic ..."

Text to classify:
"Learning Distributions from Random Walks
Abstract: We introduce a new model of distributions generated by random walks on graphs. This model suggests a variety of learning problems, using the definitions and models of distribution learning defined in [6]. Our framework is general enough to model previously studied distribution learning problems, as well as to suggest new applications. We describe special cases of the general problem, and investigate their relative difficulty. We present algorithms to solve the learning problem under various conditions."
