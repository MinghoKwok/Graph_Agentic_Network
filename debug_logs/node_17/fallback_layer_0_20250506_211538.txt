ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 17 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211538:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Neural Network Model of Memory Consolidation
Abstract: Some forms of memory rely temporarily on a system of brain structures located in the medial temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus. The recall of recent events is one task that relies crucially on the proper functioning of this system. As the event becomes less recent, the medial temporal lobe becomes less critical to the recall of the event, and the recollection appears to rely more upon the neocortex. It has been proposed that a process called consolidation is responsible for transfer of memory from the medial temporal lobe to the neocortex. We examine a network model proposed by P. Alvarez and L. Squire designed to incorporate some of the known features of consolidation, and propose several possible experiments intended to help evaluate the performance of this model under more realistic conditions. Finally, we implement an extended version of the model that can accommodate varying assumptions about the number of areas and connections within the brain and memory capacity, and examine the performance of our model on Alvarez and Squire's original task."
