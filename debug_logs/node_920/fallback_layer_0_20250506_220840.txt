ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 920 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220840:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

Text to classify:
"Maximum likelihood source separation for discrete sources
Abstract: This communication deals with the source separation problem which consists in the separation of a noisy mixture of independent sources without a priori knowledge of the mixture coefficients. In this paper, we consider the maximum likelihood (ML) approach for discrete source signals with known probability distributions. An important feature of the ML approach in Gaussian noise is that the covariance matrix of the additive noise can be treated as a parameter. Hence, it is not necessary to know or to model the spatial structure of the noise. Another striking feature offered in the case of discrete sources is that, under mild assumptions, it is possible to separate more sources than sensors. In this paper, we consider maximization of the likelihood via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm."
