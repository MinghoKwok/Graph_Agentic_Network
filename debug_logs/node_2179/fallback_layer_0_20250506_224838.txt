ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2179 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224838:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models
Abstract: The close connection between reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms has fueled research on RL within the machine learning community. Yet, despite increased theoretical understanding, RL algorithms remain applicable to simple tasks only. In this paper I use the abstract framework afforded by the connection to dynamic programming to discuss the scaling issues faced by RL researchers. I focus on learning agents that have to learn to solve multiple structured RL tasks in the same environment. I propose learning abstract environment models where the abstract actions represent "intentions" of achieving a particular state. Such models are variable temporal resolution models because in different parts of the state space the abstract actions span different number of time steps. The operational definitions of abstract actions can be learned incrementally using repeated experience at solving RL tasks. I prove that under certain conditions solutions to new RL tasks can be found by using simu lated experience with abstract actions alone."
