ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1261 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220007:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
3. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
4. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning with Modular Neural Networks for Control Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods can be applied to control problems with the o..."
5. [Label_1] "Fitness Landscapes and Difficulty in Genetic Programming Abstract: The structure of the fitness landscape on which genetic programming operates is exa..."

Text to classify:
"EVOLVING NEURAL NETWORKS WITH COLLABORATIVE SPECIES
Abstract: We present a coevolutionary architecture for solving decomposable problems and apply it to the evolution of artificial neural networks. Although this work is preliminary in nature it has a number of advantages over non-coevolutionary approaches. The coevolutionary approach utilizes a divide-and-conquer technique in which species representing simpler subtasks are evolved in separate instances of a genetic algorithm executing in parallel. Collaborations among the species are formed representing complete solutions. Species are created dynamically as needed. Results are presented in which the coevolutionary architecture produces higher quality solutions in fewer evolutionary trials when compared with an alternative non-coevolutionary approach on the problem of evolving cascade networks for parity computation."
