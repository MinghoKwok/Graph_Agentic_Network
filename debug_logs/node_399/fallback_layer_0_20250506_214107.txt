ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 399 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214107:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_0: 2 examples

- Label_5: 3 examples

"Representing and Learning Visual Schemas in Neural Networks for Scene Analysis
Abstract: Using scene analysis as the task, this research focuses on three fundamental problems in neural network systems: (1) limited processing resources, (2) representing schemas, and (3) learning schemas. The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures."
