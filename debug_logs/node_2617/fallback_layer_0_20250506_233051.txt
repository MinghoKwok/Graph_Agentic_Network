ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2617 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233051:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Predicting Ordinal Classes in ILP
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of learning to predict ordinal (i.e., ordered discrete) classes in an ILP setting. We start with a relational regression algorithm named SRT (Structural Regression Trees) and study various ways of transforming it into a first-order learner for ordinal classification tasks. Combinations of these algorithm variants with several data preprocessing methods are compared on two ILP benchmark data sets to verify the relative strengths and weaknesses of the strategies and to study the trade-off between optimal categorical classification accuracy (hit rate) and minimum distance-based error. Preliminary results indicate that this is a promising avenue towards algorithms that combine aspects of classification and regression in relational learning."
