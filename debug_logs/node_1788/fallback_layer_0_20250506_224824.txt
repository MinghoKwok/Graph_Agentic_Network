ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1788 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224824:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Path-integral evolution of chaos embedded in noise: Duffing neocortical analog
Abstract: A two dimensional time-dependent Duffing oscillator model of macroscopic neocortex exhibits chaos for some ranges of parameters. We embed this model in moderate noise, typical of the context presented in real neocortex, using PATHINT, a non-Monte-Carlo path-integral algorithm that is particularly adept in handling nonlinear Fokker-Planck systems. This approach shows promise to investigate whether chaos in neocortex, as predicted by such models, can survive in noisy contexts."
