ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1350 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222518:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"IGLUE An Instance-based Learning System over Lattice Theory
Abstract: Concept learning is one of the most studied areas in machine learning. A lot of work in this domain deals with decision trees. In this paper, we are concerned with a different kind of technique based on Galois lattices or concept lattices. We present a new semi-lattice based system, IGLUE, that uses the entropy function with a top-down approach to select concepts during the lattice construction. Then IGLUE generates new relevant numerical features by transforming initial boolean features over these concepts. IGLUE uses the new features to redescribe examples. Finally, IGLUE applies the Mahanalobis distance as a similarity measure between examples. Keywords : Multistrategy Learning, Instance-Based Learning, Galois lattice, Feature transformation"
