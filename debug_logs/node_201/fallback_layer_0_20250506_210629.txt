ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 201 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210629:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Neural net architectures for temporal sequence processing
Abstract: I present a general taxonomy of neural net architectures for processing time-varying patterns. This taxonomy subsumes many existing architectures in the literature, and points to several promising architectures that have yet to be examined. Any architecture that processes time-varying patterns requires two conceptually distinct components: a short-term memory that holds on to relevant past events and an associator that uses the short-term memory to classify or predict. My taxonomy is based on a characterization of short-term memory models along the dimensions of form, content, and adaptability. Experiments on predicting future values of a financial time series (US dollar-Swiss franc exchange rates) are presented using several alternative memory models. The results of these experiments serve as a baseline against which more sophisticated architectures can be compared. Neural networks have proven to be a promising alternative to traditional techniques for nonlinear temporal prediction tasks (e.g., Curtiss, Brandemuehl, & Kreider, 1992; Lapedes & Farber, 1987; Weigend, Huberman, & Rumelhart, 1992). However, temporal prediction is a particularly challenging problem because conventional neural net architectures and algorithms are not well suited for patterns that vary over time. The prototypical use of neural nets is in structural pattern recognition. In such a task, a collection of features|visual, semantic, or otherwise|is presented to a network and the network must categorize the input feature pattern as belonging to one or more classes. For example, a network might be trained to classify animal species based on a set of attributes describing living creatures such as "has tail", "lives in water", or "is carnivorous"; or a network could be trained to recognize visual patterns over a two-dimensional pixel array as a letter in fA; B; . . . ; Zg. In such tasks, the network is presented with all relevant information simultaneously. In contrast, temporal pattern recognition involves processing of patterns that evolve over time. The appropriate response at a particular point in time depends not only on the current input, but potentially all previous inputs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the basic framework for a temporal prediction problem. I assume that time is quantized into discrete steps, a sensible assumption because many time series of interest are intrinsically discrete, and continuous series can be sampled at a fixed interval. The input at time t is denoted x(t). For univariate series, this input"
