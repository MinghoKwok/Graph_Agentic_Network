ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 873 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220612:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On the performance of orthogonal source separation algorithms
Abstract: Source separation consists in recovering a set of n independent signals from m n observed instantaneous mixtures of these signals, possibly corrupted by additive noise. Many source separation algorithms use second order information in a whitening operation which reduces the non trivial part of the separation to determining a unitary matrix. Most of them further show a kind of invariance property which can be exploited to predict some general results about their performance. Our first contribution is to exhibit a lower bound to the performance in terms of accuracy of the separation. This bound is independent of the algorithm and, in the i.i.d. case, of the distribution of the source signals. Second, we show that the performance of invariant algorithms depends on the mixing matrix and on the noise level in a specific way. A consequence is that at low noise levels, the performance does not depend on the mixture but only on the distribution of the sources, via a function which is characteristic of the given source separation algorithm."
