ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1744 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224605:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Simple Synchrony Networks: Learning Generalisations across Syntactic Constituents
Abstract: This paper describes a training algorithm for Simple Synchrony Networks (SSNs), and reports on experiments in language learning using a recursive grammar. The SSN is a new connectionist architecture combining a technique for learning about patterns across time, Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs), with Temporal Synchrony Variable Binding (TSVB). The use of TSVB means the SSN can learn about entities in the training set, and generalise this information to entities in the test set. In the experiments, the network is trained on sentences with up to one embedded clause, and with some words restricted to certain classes of constituent. During testing, the network generalises information learned to sentences with up to three embedded clauses, and with words appearing in any constituent. These results demonstrate that SSNs learn generalisations across syntactic constituents."
