ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 422 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213630:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Genetic Self-Learning
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms are direct random search algorithms which imitate the principles of natural evolution as a method to solve adaptation (learning) tasks in general. As such they have several features in common which can be observed on the genetic and phenotypic level of living species. In this paper the algorithms' capability of adaptation or learning in a wider sense is demonstrated, and it is focused on Genetic Algorithms to illustrate the learning process on the population level (first level learning), and on Evolution Strategies to demonstrate the learning process on the meta-level of strategy parameters (second level learning)."
