ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 762 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213340:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Using Errors to Create Piecewise Learnable Partitions
Abstract: In this paper we describe an algorithm which exploits the error distribution generated by a learning algorithm in order to break up the domain which is being approximated into piecewise learnable partitions. Traditionally, the error distribution has been neglected in favor of a lump error measure such as RMS. By doing this, however, we lose a lot of important information. The error distribution tells us where the algorithm is doing badly, and if there exists a "ridge" of errors, also tells us how to partition the space so that one part of the space will not interfere with the learning of another. The algorithm builds a variable arity k-d tree whose leaves contain the partitions. Using this tree, new points can be predicted using the correct partition by traversing the tree. We instantiate this algorithm using memory based learners and cross-validation."
