ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2404 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232030:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Model for Projection and Action
Abstract: In designing autonomous agents that deal competently with issues involving time and space, there is a tradeoff to be made between guaranteed response-time reactions on the one hand, and flexibility and expressiveness on the other. We propose a model of action with probabilistic reasoning and decision analytic evaluation for use in a layered control architecture. Our model is well suited to tasks that require reasoning about the interaction of behaviors and events in a fixed temporal horizon. Decisions are continuously reevaluated, so that there is no problem with plans becoming obsolete as new information becomes available. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the tradeoffs required to guarantee a fixed reponse time in reasoning about nondeterministic cause-and- effect relationships. By exploiting approximate decision making processes, we are able to trade accuracy in our predictions for speed in decision making in order to improve expected per"
