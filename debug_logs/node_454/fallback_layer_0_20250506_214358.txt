ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 454 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214358:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Towards Formalizations in Case-Based Reasoning for Synthesis
Abstract: This paper presents the formalization of a novel approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation in case-based reasoning (Cbr) for synthesis. The approach has been informally presented, exemplified, and implemented for the domain of industrial building design (Borner 1993). By relating the approach to existing theories we provide the foundation of its systematic evaluation and appropriate usage. Cases, the primary repository of knowledge, are represented structurally using an algebraic approach. Similarity relations provide structure preserving case modifications modulo the underlying algebra and an equational theory over the algebra (so available). This representation of a modeled universe of discourse enables theory-based inference of adapted solutions. The approach enables us to incorporate formally generalization, abstraction, geometrical transformation, and their combinations into Cbr."
