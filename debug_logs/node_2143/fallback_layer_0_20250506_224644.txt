ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2143 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224644:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"MULTIPLE SCALES OF BRAIN-MIND INTERACTIONS
Abstract: Posner and Raichle's Images of Mind is an excellent educational book and very well written. Some aws as a scientific publication are: (a) the accuracy of the linear subtraction method used in PET is subject to scrutiny by further research at finer spatial-temporal resolutions; (b) lack of accuracy of the experimental paradigm used for EEG complementary studies. Images (Posner & Raichle, 1994) is an excellent introduction to interdisciplinary research in cognitive and imaging science. Well written and illustrated, it presents concepts in a manner well suited both to the layman/undergraduate and to the technical nonexpert/graduate student and postdoctoral researcher. Many, not all, people involved in interdisciplinary neuroscience research agree with the P & R's statements on page 33, on the importance of recognizing emergent properties of brain function from assemblies of neurons. It is clear from the sparse references that this book was not intended as a standalone review of a broad field. There are some aws in the scientific development, but this must be expected in such a pioneering venture. P & R hav e proposed many cognitive mechanisms deserving further study with imaging tools yet to be developed which can yield better spatial-temporal resolutions."
