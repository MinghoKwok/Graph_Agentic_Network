ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2665 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233844:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Parametric Design Problem Solving
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to understand what is involved in parametric design problem solving. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we formulate a generic model of parametric design problem solving. We then redescribe a number of problem solving methods in terms of the proposed generic model and we show that such a redescription enables us to provide a more precise account of the different competence behaviours expressed by the methods in Design is about constructing artifacts. This means that, broadly speaking, any design process is 'creative', in the sense that a design process produces a 'new solution', as opposed to selecting a solution from a predefined set. While recognizing the essential creative elements present in any design process, researchers, e.g. Gero (1990), restrict the use of the term 'creative design' to those design applications where the design elements of the target artifact cannot be selected from a predefined set. For instance, when designing a new car model it is normally the case that some design innovations are included, which were not present in previous car designs. In other words it is not (always) possible to characterise the process of designing a new car as one in which components are assembled and configured from a predefined set. Nevertheless, in a large number of real-world applications it is possible to assume that the target artifact is going to be designed in terms of predefined design elements. In such a scenario the design process consists of assembling and configuring these preexisting design elements in a way which satisfies the design requirements and constraints, and approximates some, typically cost-related, optimization criterion. This class of design tasks takes the name of configuration design (Stefik, 1995). In many cases, typically when the problem in hand does not exhibit complex spatial requirements and all possible solutions adhere to a common solution template, it is possible to simplify the configuration design problem even further, by modelling the target artifact as a set of parameters and characterizing design problem solving as the process of assigning values to parameters in accordance with the given design requirements, constraints, and optimization criterion. When this assumption is true for a particular task, we say that this is a parametric design task. The VT application (Marcus et al., 1988; Yost and Rothenfluh, 1996) provides a well-known example of a parametric design task. The aim of this paper is to understand what is involved in parametric design problem solving. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we produce a generic model of parametric design problem solving, characterised at the knowledge level, which generalizes from existing methods for parametric design. We then redescribe a number of problem solving methods in terms of the question."
