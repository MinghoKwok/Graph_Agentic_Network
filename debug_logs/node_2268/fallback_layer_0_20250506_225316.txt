ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2268 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225316:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"SPERT: A VLIW/SIMD Microprocessor for Artificial Neural Network Computations
Abstract: SPERT (Synthetic PERceptron Testbed) is a fully programmable single chip microprocessor designed for efficient execution of artificial neural network algorithms. The first implementation will be in a 1.2 m CMOS technology with a 50MHz clock rate, and a prototype system is being designed to occupy a double SBus slot within a Sun Sparcstation. SPERT will sustain over 300 fi 10 6 connections per second during pattern classification, and around 100 fi 10 6 connection updates per second while running the popular error backpropagation training algorithm. This represents a speedup of around two orders of magnitude over a Sparcstation-2 for algorithms of interest. An earlier system produced by our group, the Ring Array Processor (RAP), used commercial DSP chips. Compared with a RAP multiprocessor of similar performance, SPERT represents over an order of magnitude reduction in cost for problems where fixed-point arithmetic is satisfactory. fl International Computer Science Institute, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94704"
