ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 362 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211315:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."

Text to classify:
"Learning Topology-Preserving Maps Using Self-Supervised Backpropagation
Abstract: Self-supervised backpropagation is an unsupervised learning procedure for feedforward networks, where the desired output vector is identical with the input vector. For backpropagation, we are able to use powerful simulators running on parallel machines. Topology-preserving maps, on the other hand, can be developed by a variant of the competitive learning procedure. However, in a degenerate case, self-supervised backpropagation is a version of competitive learning. A simple extension of the cost function of backpropagation leads to a competitive version of self-supervised backpropagation, which can be used to produce topographic maps. We demonstrate the approach applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)."
