ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1469 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223134:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Warning: missing six few referencesfixed in proceedings. Learning with Queries but Incomplete Information (Extended Abstract)
Abstract: We investigate learning with membership and equivalence queries assuming that the information provided to the learner is incomplete. By incomplete we mean that some of the membership queries may be answered by I don't know. This model is a worst-case version of the incomplete membership query model of Angluin and Slonim. It attempts to model practical learning situations, including an experiment of Lang and Baum that we describe, where the teacher may be unable to answer reliably some queries that are critical for the learning algorithm. We present algorithms to learn monotone k-term DNF with membership queries only, and to learn monotone DNF with membership and equivalence queries. Compared to the complete information case, the query complexity increases by an additive term linear in the number of I don't know answers received. We also observe that the blowup in the number of queries can in general be exponential for both our new model and the incomplete membership model."
