ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 101 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210214:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Relevant Features Abstract: This paper describes efficient methods for exact and approximate implementation of th..."
2. [Label_0] "On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greedine..."
3. [Label_2] "The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification Abstract: We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the..."
4. [Label_6] "Pac Learning, Noise, and Geometry Abstract: This paper describes the probably approximately correct model of concept learning, paying special attentio..."
5. [Label_0] "A systematic description of greedy optimisation algorithms for cost sensitive generalisation Abstract: This paper defines a class of problems involvin..."

Text to classify:
"Adaptive Noise Injection for Input Variables Relevance Determination
Abstract: In this paper we consider the application of training with noise in multi-layer perceptron to input variables relevance determination. Noise injection is modified in order to penalize irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm is attractive as it requires the tuning of a single parameter. This parameter controls the penalization of the inputs together with the complexity of the model. After the presentation of the method, experimental evidences are given on simulated data sets."
