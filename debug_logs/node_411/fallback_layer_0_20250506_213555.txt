ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 411 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213555:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"POWER OF NEURAL NETS
Abstract: Report SYCON-91-11 ABSTRACT This paper deals with the simulation of Turing machines by neural networks. Such networks are made up of interconnections of synchronously evolving processors, each of which updates its state according to a "sigmoidal" linear combination of the previous states of all units. The main result states that one may simulate all Turing machines by nets, in linear time. In particular, it is possible to give a net made up of about 1,000 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function. (This is an update of Report SYCON-91-08; new results include the simulation in linear time of binary-tape machines, as opposed to the unary alphabets used in the previous version.)"
