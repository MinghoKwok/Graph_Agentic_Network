ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1722 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222432:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"BAYESIAN TIME SERIES: Models and Computations for the Analysis of Time Series in the Physical Sciences
Abstract: This articles discusses developments in Bayesian time series mod-elling and analysis relevant in studies of time series in the physical and engineering sciences. With illustrations and references, we discuss: Bayesian inference and computation in various state-space models, with examples in analysing quasi-periodic series; isolation and modelling of various components of error in time series; decompositions of time series into significant latent subseries; nonlinear time series models based on mixtures of auto-regressions; problems with errors and uncertainties in the timing of observations; and the development of non-linear models based on stochastic deformations of time scales."
