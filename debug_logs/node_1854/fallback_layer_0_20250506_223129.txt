ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1854 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223129:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
5. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."

Text to classify:
"Case Retrieval Nets: Basic Ideas and Extensions
Abstract: An efficient retrieval of a relatively small number of relevant cases from a huge case base is a crucial subtask of Case-Based Reasoning. In this article, we present Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs), a memory model that has recently been developed for this task. The main idea is to apply a spreading activation process to a net-like case memory in order to retrieve cases being similar to a posed query case. We summarize the basic ideas of CRNs, suggest some useful extensions, and present some initial experimental results which suggest that CRNs can successfully handle case bases larger than considered usually in the CBR community."
