ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1440 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223002:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Value Function Approximations and Job-Shop Scheduling
Abstract: We report a successful application of TD() with value function approximation to the task of job-shop scheduling. Our scheduling problems are based on the problem of scheduling payload processing steps for the NASA space shuttle program. The value function is approximated by a 2-layer feedforward network of sigmoid units. A one-step lookahead greedy algorithm using the learned evaluation function outperforms the best existing algorithm for this task, which is an iterative repair method incorporating simulated annealing. To understand the reasons for this performance improvement, this paper introduces several measurements of the learning process and discusses several hypotheses suggested by these measurements. We conclude that the use of value function approximation is not a source of difficulty for our method, and in fact, it may explain the success of the method independent of the use of value iteration. Additional experiments are required to discriminate among our hypotheses."
