ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 252 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210838:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Modular Q-Learning Architecture for Manipulator Task Decomposition `Data storage in the cerebellar model ar
Abstract: Compositional Q-Learning (CQ-L) (Singh 1992) is a modular approach to learning to perform composite tasks made up of several elemental tasks by reinforcement learning. Skills acquired while performing elemental tasks are also applied to solve composite tasks. Individual skills compete for the right to act and only winning skills are included in the decomposition of the composite task. We extend the original CQ-L concept in two ways: (1) a more general reward function, and (2) the agent can have more than one actuator. We use the CQ-L architecture to acquire skills for performing composite tasks with a simulated two-linked manipulator having large state and action spaces. The manipulator is a non-linear dynamical system and we require its end-effector to be at specific positions in the workspace. Fast function approximation in each of the Q-modules is achieved through the use of an array of Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) (Albus Our research interests involve the scaling up of machine learning methods, especially reinforcement learning, for autonomous robot control. We are interested in function approximators suitable for reinforcement learning in problems with large state spaces, such as the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) (Albus 1975) which permit fast, online learning and good local generalization. In addition, we are interested in task decomposition by reinforcement learning and the use of hierarchical and modular function approximator architectures. We are examining the effectiveness of a modified Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) (Jordan & Jacobs 1993) approach for reinforcement learning since the original HME was developed mainly for supervised learning and batch learning tasks. The incorporation of domain knowledge into reinforcement learning agents is an important way of extending their capabilities. Default policies can be specified, and domain knowledge can also be used to restrict the size of the state-action space, leading to faster learning. We are investigating the use of Q-Learning (Watkins 1989) in planning tasks, using a classifier system (Holland 1986) to encode the necessary condition-action rules. Jordan, M. & Jacobs, R.
