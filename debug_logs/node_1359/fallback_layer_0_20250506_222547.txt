ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1359 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222547:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Extracting Comprehensible Concept Representations from Trained Neural Networks
Abstract: Although they are applicable to a wide array of problems, and have demonstrated good performance on a number of difficult, real-world tasks, neural networks are not usually applied to problems in which comprehensibility of the acquired concepts is important. The concept representations formed by neural networks are hard to understand because they typically involve distributed, nonlinear relationships encoded by a large number of real-valued parameters. To address this limitation, we have been developing algorithms for extracting "symbolic" concept representations from trained neural networks. We first discuss why it is important to be able to understand the concept representations formed by neural networks. We then briefly describe our approach and discuss a number of issues pertaining to comprehensibility that have arisen in our work. Finally, we discuss choices that we have made in our research to date, and open research issues that we have not yet addressed."
