ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2432 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230205:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning the Peg-into-Hole Assembly Operation with a Connectionist Reinforcement Technique
Abstract: The paper presents a learning controller that is capable of increasing insertion speed during consecutive peg-into-hole operations, without increasing the contact force level. Our aim is to find a better relationship between measured forces and the controlled velocity, without using a complicated (human generated) model. We followed a connectionist approach. Two learning phases are distinguished. First the learning controller is trained (or initialised) in a supervised way by a suboptimal task frame controller. Then a reinforcement learning phase follows. The controller consists of two networks: (1) the policy network and (2) the exploration network. On-line robotic exploration plays a crucial role in obtaining a better policy. Optionally, this architecture can be extended with a third network: the reinforcement network. The learning controller is implemented on a CAD-based contact force simulator. In contrast with most other related work, the experiments are simulated in 3D with 6 degrees of freedom. Performance of a peg-into-hole task is measured in insertion time and average/maximum force level. The fact that a better performance can be obtained in this way, demonstrates the importance of model-free learning techniques for repetitive robotic assembly tasks. The paper presents the approach and simulation results. Keywords: robotic assembly, peg-into-hole, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning."
