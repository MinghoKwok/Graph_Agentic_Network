ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 249 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212725:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Control Flow Prediction For Dynamic ILP Processors
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the ability of dynamic ILP processors to exploit (speculatively executed) parallelism. Existing branch prediction mechanisms used to establish a dynamic window from which ILP can be extracted are limited in their abilities to: (i) create a large, accurate dynamic window, (ii) initiate a large number of instructions into this window in every cycle, and (iii) traverse multiple branches of the control flow graph per prediction. We introduce control flow prediction which uses information in the control flow graph of a program to overcome these limitations. We discuss how information present in the control flow graph can be represented using multiblocks, and conveyed to the hardware using Control Flow Tables and Control Flow Prediction Buffers. We evaluate the potential of control flow prediction on an abstract machine and on a dynamic ILP processing model. Our results indicate that control flow prediction is a powerful and effective assist to the hardware in making more informed run time decisions about program control flow."
