ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1637 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224026:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"The Effective Size of a Neural Network: A Principal Component Approach
Abstract: Often when learning from data, one attaches a penalty term to a standard error term in an attempt to prefer simple models and prevent overfitting. Current penalty terms for neural networks, however, often do not take into account weight interaction. This is a critical drawback since the effective number of parameters in a network usually differs dramatically from the total number of possible parameters. In this paper, we present a penalty term that uses Principal Component Analysis to help detect functional redundancy in a neural network. Results show that our new algorithm gives a much more accurate estimate of network complexity than do standard approaches. As a result, our new term should be able to improve techniques that make use of a penalty term, such as weight decay, weight pruning, feature selection, Bayesian, and prediction-risk tech niques."
