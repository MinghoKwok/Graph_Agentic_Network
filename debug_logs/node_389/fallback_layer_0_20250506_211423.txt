You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Robustness Analysis of Bayesian Networks with Finitely Generated Convex Sets of Distributions
Abstract: This paper presents exact solutions and convergent approximations for inferences in Bayesian networks associated with finitely generated convex sets of distributions. Robust Bayesian inference is the calculation of bounds on posterior values given perturbations in a probabilistic model. The paper presents exact inference algorithms and analyzes the circumstances where exact inference becomes intractable. Two classes of algorithms for numeric approximations are developed through transformations on the original model. The first transformation reduces the robust inference problem to the estimation of probabilistic parameters in a Bayesian network. The second transformation uses Lavine's bracketing algorithm to generate a sequence of maximization problems in a Bayesian network. The analysis is extended to the *-contaminated, the lower density bounded, the belief function, the sub-sigma, the density bounded, the total variation and the density ratio classes of distributions. c fl1996 Carnegie Mellon University"
