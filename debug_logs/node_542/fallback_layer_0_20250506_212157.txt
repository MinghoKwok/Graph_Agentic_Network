ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 542 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212157:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."
3. [Label_2] "Using Neural Networks for Descriptive Statistical Analysis of Educational Data Abstract: In this paper we discuss the methodological issues of using a..."
4. [Label_2] "Application of Neural Networks for the Classification of Diffuse Liver Disease by Quantitative Echography Abstract: Three different methods were inves..."
5. [Label_5] "A Comparison of Pruning Methods for Relational Concept Learning Abstract: Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning are two standard methods of dealing with noise ..."

Text to classify:
"Comparison of Bayesian and Neural Net Unsupervised Classification Techniques
Abstract: Unsupervised classification is the classification of data into a number of classes in such a way that data in each class are all similar to each other. In the past there have been few if any studies done to compare the performance of different unsupervised classification techniques. In this paper we review Bayesian and neural net approaches to unsupervised classification and present results of experiments that we did to compare Autoclass, a Bayesian classification system, and ART2, a neural net classification algorithm."
