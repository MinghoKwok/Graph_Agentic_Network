ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 194 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213018:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 4 examples

"Improving the Quality of Automatic DNA Sequence Assembly using Fluorescent Trace-Data Classifications
Abstract: Virtually all large-scale sequencing projects use automatic sequence-assembly programs to aid in the determination of DNA sequences. The computer-generated assemblies require substantial handediting to transform them into submissions for GenBank. As the size of sequencing projects increases, it becomes essential to improve the quality of the automated assemblies so that this time-consuming handediting may be reduced. Current ABI sequencing technology uses base calls made from fluorescently-labeled DNA fragments run on gels. We present a new representation for the fluorescent trace data associated with individual base calls. This representation can be used before, during, and after fragment assembly to improve the quality of assemblies. We demonstrate one such use end-trimming of suboptimal data that results in a significant improvement in the quality of subsequent assemblies."
