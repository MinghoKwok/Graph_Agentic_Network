ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2260 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231306:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Radial Basis Functions for Process Control
Abstract: Radial basis function (RBFs) neural networks provide an attractive method for high dimensional nonparametric estimation for use in nonlinear control. They are faster to train than conventional feedforward networks with sigmoidal activation networks ("backpropagation nets"), and provide a model structure better suited for adaptive control. This article gives a brief survey of the use of RBFs and then introduces a new statistical interpretation of radial basis functions and a new method of estimating the parameters, using the EM algorithm. This new statistical interpretation allows us to provide confidence limits on predictions made using the networks."
