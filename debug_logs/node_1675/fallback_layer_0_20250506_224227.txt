ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1675 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224227:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Study of Genetic Algorithms to Find Approximate Solutions to Hard 3CNF Problems
Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been used to solve hard optimization problems ranging from the Travelling Salesman problem to the Quadratic Assignment problem. We show that the Simple Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve an optimization problem derived from the 3-Conjunctive Normal Form problem. By separating the populations into small sub-populations, parallel genetic algorithms exploits the inherent parallelism in genetic algorithms and prevents premature convergence. Genetic algorithms using hill-climbing conduct genetic search in the space of local optima, and hill-climbing can be less com-putationally expensive than genetic search. We examine the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the quality of solutions of 3CNF problems."
