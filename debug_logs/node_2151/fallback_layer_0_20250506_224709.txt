ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2151 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224709:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
2. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
3. [Label_0] "Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant featu..."
4. [Label_0] "Improving Minority Class Prediction Using Case-Specific Feature Weights Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of handling skewed class distributi..."
5. [Label_5] "on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning..."

Text to classify:
"A Yardstick for the Evaluation of Case-Based Classifiers
Abstract: This paper proposes that the generalisation capabilities of a case-based reasoning system can be evaluated by comparison with a `rote-learning' algorithm which uses a very simple generalisation strategy. Two such algorithms are defined, and expressions for their classification accuracy are derived as a function of the size of training sample. A series of experiments using artificial and `natural' data sets is described in which the learning curve for a case-based learner is compared with those for the apparently trivial rote-learning learning algorithms. The results show that in a number of `plausible' situations, the learning curves for a simple case-based learner and the `majority' rote-learner can barely be distinguished, although a domain is demonstrated where favourable performance from the case-based learner is observed. This suggests that the maxim of case-based reasoning that `similar problems have similar solutions' may be useful as the basis of a generalisation strategy only in selected domains."
