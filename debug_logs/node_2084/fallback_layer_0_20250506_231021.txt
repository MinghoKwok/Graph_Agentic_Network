ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2084 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231021:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Synthesize, Optimize, Analyze, Repeat (SOAR): Application of Neural Network Tools to ECG Patient Monitoring
Abstract: Results are reported from the application of tools for synthesizing, optimizing and analyzing neural networks to an ECG Patient Monitoring task. A neural network was synthesized from a rule-based classifier and optimized over a set of normal and abnormal heartbeats. The classification error rate on a separate and larger test set was reduced by a factor of 2. Sensitivity analysis of the synthesized and optimized networks revealed informative differences. Analysis of the weights and unit activations of the optimized network enabled a reduction in size of the network by a factor of 40% without loss of accuracy."
