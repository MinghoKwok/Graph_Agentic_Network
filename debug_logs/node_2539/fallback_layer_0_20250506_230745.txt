ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2539 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230745:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Mining for Causes of Cancer: Machine Learning Experiments at Various Levels of Detail
Abstract: This paper presents first results of an interdisciplinary project in scientific data mining. We analyze data about the carcinogenicity of chemicals derived from the carcinogenesis bioassay program performed by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The database contains detailed descriptions of 6823 tests performed with more than 330 compounds and animals of different species, strains and sexes. The chemical structures are described at the atom and bond level, and in terms of various relevant structural properties. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects that various levels of detail and amounts of information have on the resulting hypotheses, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We apply relational and propositional machine learning algorithms to learning problems formulated as regression or as classification tasks. In addition, these experiments have been conducted with two learning problems which are at different levels of detail. Quantitatively, our experiments indicate that additional information not necessarily improves accuracy. Qualitatively, a number of potential discoveries have been made by the algorithm for Relational Regression because it can utilize all the information contained in the relations of the database as well as in the numerical dependent variable."
