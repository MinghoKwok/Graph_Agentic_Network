ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 756 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215413:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Knowledge Acquisition via Knowledge Integration
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our aim is to construct an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. The need to merge knowledge bases can arise, for example, when knowledge bases are acquired independently from interactions with several domain experts. As opinions of different domain experts may differ, the knowledge bases constructed in this way will normally differ too. A similar problem can also arise whenever separate knowledge bases are generated by learning algorithms. The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has a good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration, describe the implemented system (INTEG.3), and present some concrete results which demonstrate the advantages of this method."
