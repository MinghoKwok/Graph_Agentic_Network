ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1831 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223016:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."
3. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
4. [Label_1] "Fitness Landscapes and Difficulty in Genetic Programming Abstract: The structure of the fitness landscape on which genetic programming operates is exa..."

"Some Training Subset Selection Methods for Supervised Learning in Genetic Programming
Abstract: When using the Genetic Programming (GP) Algorithm on a difficult problem with a large set of training cases, a large population size is needed and a very large number of function-tree evaluations must be carried out. This paper describes how to reduce the number of such evaluations by selecting a small subset of the training data set on which to actually carry out the GP algorithm. Three subset selection methods described in the paper are: Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS), using the current GP run to select `difficult' and/or disused cases, Historical Subset Selection (HSS), using previous GP runs, Random Subset Selection (RSS). GP, GP+DSS, GP+HSS, GP+RSS are compared on a large classification problem. GP+DSS can produce better results in less than 20% of the time taken by GP. GP+HSS can nearly match the results of GP, and, perhaps surprisingly, GP+RSS can occasionally approach the results of GP. GP and GP+DSS are then compared on a smaller problem, and a hybrid Dynamic Fitness Function (DFF), based on DSS, is proposed."
