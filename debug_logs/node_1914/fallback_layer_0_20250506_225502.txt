ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1914 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225502:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Local Feedforward Networks
Abstract: Although feedforward neural networks are well suited to function approximation, in some applications networks experience problems when learning a desired function. One problem is interference which occurs when learning in one area of the input space causes unlearning in another area. Networks that are less susceptible to interference are referred to as spatially local networks. To understand these properties, a theoretical framework, consisting of a measure of interference and a measure of network localization, is developed that incorporates not only the network weights and architecture but also the learning algorithm. Using this framework to analyze sigmoidal multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks that employ the back-prop learning algorithm, we address a familiar misconception that sigmoidal networks are inherently non-local by demonstrating that given a sufficiently large number of adjustable parameters, sigmoidal MLPs can be made arbitrarily local while retaining the ability to represent any continuous function on a compact domain."
