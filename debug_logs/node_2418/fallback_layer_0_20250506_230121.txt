ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2418 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230121:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Homology Detection via Family Pairwise Search a straightforward generalization of pairwise sequence comparison algorithms to Abstract: The function of..."
2. [Label_2] "The megaprior heuristic for discovering protein sequence patterns Abstract: Several computer algorithms for discovering patterns in groups of protein ..."
3. [Label_1] "Genetic Algorithms For Vertex Splitting in DAGs 1 Abstract: 1 This paper has been submitted to the 5th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms ..."
4. [Label_2] "Optimal Alignments in Linear Space using Automaton-derived Cost Functions (Extended Abstract) Submitted to CPM'96 Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95]..."
5. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."

Text to classify:
"A Fast Algorithm for the Computation and Enumeration of Perfect Phylogenies
Abstract: The Perfect Phylogeny Problem is a classical problem in computational evolutionary biology, in which a set of species/taxa is described by a set of qualitative characters. In recent years, the problem has been shown to be NP-Complete in general, while the different fixed parameter versions can each be solved in polynomial time. In particular, Agarwala and Fernandez-Baca have developed an O(2 3r (nk 3 +k 4 )) algorithm for the perfect phylogeny problem for n species defined by k r-state characters. Since commonly the character data is drawn from alignments of molecular sequences, k is the length of the sequences and can thus be very large (in the hundreds or thousands). Thus, it is imperative to develop algorithms which run efficiently for large values of k. In this paper we make additional observations about the structure of the problem and produce an algorithm for the problem that runs in time O(2 2r k 2 n). We also show how it is possible to efficiently build a structure that implicitly represents the set of all perfect phylogenies, and to randomly sample from that set."
