ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1271 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220044:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "Feature Generation for Sequence Categorization Abstract: The problem of sequence categorization is to generalize from a corpus of labeled sequences pr..."
2. [Label_5] "Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisit..."
3. [Label_5] "on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning..."
4. [Label_0] "LINNEO A Classification Methodology for Ill-structured Domains Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover ..."
5. [Label_0] "Learning to Predict User Operations for Adaptive Scheduling Abstract: Mixed-initiative systems present the challenge of finding an effective level of ..."

Text to classify:
"Beyond Correlation: Bringing Artificial Intelligence to Events Data
Abstract: The Feature Vector Editor offers a user-extensible environment for exploratory data analysis. Several empirical studies have applied this environment to the SHER-FACS International Conflict Management dataset. Current analysis techniques include boolean analysis, temporal analysis, and automatic rule learning. Implemented portably in ANSI Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM), the system features an advanced interface that makes it intuitive for people to manipulate data and discover significant relationships. The system encapsulates data within objects and defines generic protocols that mediate all interactions between data, users and analysis algorithms. Generic data protocols make possible rapid integration of new datasets and new analytical algorithms with heterogeneous data formats. More sophisticated research reformulates SHERFACS conflict codings as machine-parsable narratives suitable for processing into semantic representations by the RELATUS Natural Language System. Experiments with 244 SHERFACS cases demonstrated the feasibility of building knowledge bases from synthetic texts exceeding 600 pages."
