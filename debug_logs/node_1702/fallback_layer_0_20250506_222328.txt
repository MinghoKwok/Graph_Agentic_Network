ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1702 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222328:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
3. [Label_3] "Algebraic Techniques for Efficient Inference in Bayesian Networks Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic ..."
4. [Label_6] "Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive chara..."

"Decision Graphs An Extension of Decision Trees
Abstract: Technical Report No: 92/173 (C) Jonathan Oliver 1992 Shortened appeared in AI and Statistics 1993[14] Abstract: In this paper, we examine Decision Graphs, a generalization of decision trees. We present an inference scheme to construct decision graphs using the Minimum Message Length Principle. Empirical tests demonstrate that this scheme compares favourably with other decision tree inference schemes. This work provides a metric for comparing the relative merit of the decision tree and decision graph formalisms for a particular domain."
