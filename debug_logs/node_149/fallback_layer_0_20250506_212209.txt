ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 149 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212209:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Corporate Memories as Distributed Case Libraries
Abstract: Rising operating costs and structural transformations such as resizing and globaliza-tion of companies all over the world have brought into focus the emerging discipline of knowledge management that is concerned with making knowledge pay off. Corporate memories form an important part of such knowledge management initiatives in a company. In this paper, we discuss how viewing corporate memories as distributed case libraries can benefit from existing techniques for distributed case-based reasoning for resource discovery and exploitation of previous expertise. We present two techniques developed in the context of multi-agent case-based reasoning for accessing and exploiting past experience from corporate memory resources. The first approach, called Negotiated Retrieval, deals with retrieving and assembling "case pieces" from different resources in a corporate memory to form a good overall case. The second approach, based on Federated Peer Learning, deals with two modes of cooperation called DistCBR and ColCBR that let an agent exploit the experience and expertise of peer agents to achieve a local task. fl The first author would like to acknowledge the support by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. IRI-9523419 and EEC-9209623. The second author's research reported in this paper has been developed at the IIIA inside the ANALOG Project funded by Spanish CICYT grant 122/93.
