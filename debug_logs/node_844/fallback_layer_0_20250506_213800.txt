ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 844 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213800:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

3. [Label_1] "Testing the Robustness of the Genetic Algorithm on the Floating Building Block Representation. Abstract: Recent studies on a floating building block r..."
4. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."

"Evolving Compact Solutions in Genetic Programming: A Case Study
Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) is a variant of genetic algorithms where the data structures handled are trees. This makes GP especially useful for evolving functional relationships or computer programs, as both can be represented as trees. Symbolic regression is the determination of a function dependence y = g(x) that approximates a set of data points (x i ; y i ). In this paper the feasibility of symbolic regression with GP is demonstrated on two examples taken from different domains. Furthermore several suggested methods from literature are compared that are intended to improve GP performance and the readability of solutions by taking into account introns or redundancy that occurs in the trees and keeping the size of the trees small. The experiments show that GP is an elegant and useful tool to derive complex functional dependencies on numerical data."
