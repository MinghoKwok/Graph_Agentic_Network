ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2448 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230255:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_3] "IMPROVING THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION VIA THE USE OF MIXTURE DISTRIBUTIONS Abstract: Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximati..."
4. [Label_1] "Unsupervised Learning with the Soft-Means Algorithm Abstract: This note describes a useful adaptation of the `peak seeking' regime used in unsupervise..."

Text to classify:
"Automatic Smoothing Spline Projection Pursuit  Automatic Smoothing Spline Projection Pursuit.
Abstract: kj = 1. The standard PPR algorithm of Friedman and Stuet-zle (1981) estimates the smooth functions f j using the supersmoother nonparametric scatterplot smoother. Friedman's algorithm constructs a model with M max linear combinations, then prunes back to a simpler model of size M M max , where M and M max are specified by the user. This paper discusses an alternative algorithm in which the smooth functions are estimated using smoothing splines. The direction coefficients ff j , the amount of smoothing in each direction, and the number of terms M and M max are determined to optimize a single generalized cross-validation measure."
