Abstract: Empirical Learning Results in POLLYANNA The value of empirical learning is demonstrated by results of testing the theory space search (TSS) component of POLLYANNA. Empirical data shows approximations generated from generic simplifying assumptions to have widely varying levels of accuracy and efficiency. The candidate theory space includes some theories with Pareto optimal combinations of accuracy and efficiency, as well as others that are non-optimal. Empirical learning is thus needed to separate the optimal theories from the non-optimal ones. It works as a filter on the process of generating approximations from generic simplifying assumptions. Empirical tests serve an additional purpose as well. Theory space search collects data that precisely characterizes the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency among the candidate approximate theories. The tradeoff data can be used to select a theory that best balances the competing objectives of accuracy and efficiency in a manner appropriate to the intended performance context. The feasibility of empirical learning is also addressed by results of testing the theory space search component of POLLYANNA. In order for empirical testing to be feasible, candidate approximate theories must be operationally usable. Candidate hearts theories generated by POLLYANNA are shown to be operationally usable by experimental results from the theory space search (TSS) phase of learning. They run on a real machine producing results that can be compared with training examples. Feasibility also depends on the information and computation costs of empirical testing. Information costs result from the need to supply the system with training examples. Computation costs result from the need to execute candidate theories. Both types of costs grow with the numbers of candidate theories to be tested. Experimental results show that empirical testing in POLLYANNA is limited more by the computation costs of executing candidate theories than by the information costs of obtaining many training examples. POLLYANNA contrasts in this respect with traditional inductive learning systems. The feasibility of empirical learning depends also on the intended performance context, and on the resources available in the context of learning. Measurements from the theory space search phase indicate that TSS algorithms performing exhaustive search would not be feasible for the hearts domain, although they may be feasible for other applications. TSS algorithms that avoid exhaustive search hold considerably more promise."

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
