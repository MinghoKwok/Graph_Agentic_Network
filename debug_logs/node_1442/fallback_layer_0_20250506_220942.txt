ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1442 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220942:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."
2. [Label_5] "Learning by Refining Algorithm Sketches Abstract: In this paper we suggest a mechanism that improves significantly the performance of a top-down induc..."
3. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
4. [Label_0] "Goal-Driven Learning: Fundamental Issues (A Symposium Report) Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, and Education, a growing body of resea..."
5. [Label_5] "The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for log..."

Text to classify:
"Learning Goal-Decomposition Rules using Exercises
Abstract: Exercises are problems ordered in increasing order of difficulty. Teaching problem-solving through exercises is a widely used pedagogic technique. A computational reason for this is that the knowledge gained by solving simple problems is useful in efficiently solving more difficult problems. We adopt this approach of learning from exercises to acquire search-control knowledge in the form of goal-decomposition rules (d-rules). D-rules are first order, and are learned using a new "generalize-and-test" algorithm which is based on inductive logic programming techniques. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by applying it in two planning do mains."
