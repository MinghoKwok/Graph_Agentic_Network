ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1551 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223554:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Performance Analysis of the CNS-1 on Large, Dense Backpropagation Networks Connectionist Network Supercomputer
Abstract: We determine in this study the sustained performance of the CNS-1 during training and evaluation of large multilayered feedforward neural networks. Using a sophisticated coding, the 128-node machine would achieve up to 111 Giga connections per second (GCPS) and 22 Giga connection updates per second (GCUPS). During recall the machine would archieve 87% of the peak multiply-accumulate performance. The training of large nets is less efficient than the recall but only by a factor of 1.5 to 2. The benchmark is parallelized and the machine code is optimized before analyzing the performance. Starting from an optimal parallel algorithm, CNS specific optimizations still reduce the run time by a factor of 4 for recall and by a factor of 3 for training. Our analysis also yields some strategies for code optimization. The CNS-1 is still in design, and therefore we have to model the run time behavior of the memory system and the interconnection network. This gives us the option of changing some parameters of the CNS-1 system in order to analyze their performance impact."
