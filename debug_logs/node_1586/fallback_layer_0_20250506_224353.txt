ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1586 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224353:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"On the Boosting Ability of Top-Down Decision Tree Learning Algorithms provably optimal for decision tree
Abstract: We analyze the performance of top-down algorithms for decision tree learning, such as those employed by the widely used C4.5 and CART software packages. Our main result is a proof that such algorithms are boosting algorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top-down algorithms we study will amplify this weak advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy. The bounds we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on the splitting criterion used by the top-down algorithm. More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1=2 fl as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees of size (1=*) O(1=fl 2 * 2 ) and (1=*) O(log(1=*)=fl 2 ) (respectively) suffice to drive the error below *. Thus (for example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger fl A preliminary version of this paper appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, pages 459-468, ACM Press, 1996.
