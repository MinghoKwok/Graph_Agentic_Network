ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1529 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224053:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Explanation Based Learning: A Comparison of Symbolic and Neural Network Approaches
Abstract: Explanation based learning has typically been considered a symbolic learning method. An explanation based learning method that utilizes purely neural network representations (called EBNN) has recently been developed, and has been shown to have several desirable properties, including robustness to errors in the domain theory. This paper briefly summarizes the EBNN algorithm, then explores the correspondence between this neural network based EBL method and EBL methods based on symbolic representations."
