ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 917 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220241:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Practical Bayesian Inference Using Mixtures of Mixtures
Abstract: Discrete mixtures of normal distributions are widely used in modeling amplitude fluctuations of electrical potentials at synapses of human, and other animal nervous systems. The usual framework has independent data values y j arising as y j = j + x n 0 +j where the means j come from some discrete prior G() and the unknown x n 0 +j 's and observed x j ; j = 1; : : : ; n 0 are gaussian noise terms. A practically important development of the associated statistical methods is the issue of non-normality of the noise terms, often the norm rather than the exception in the neurological context. We have recently developed models, based on convolutions of Dirichlet process mixtures, for such problems. Explicitly, we model the noise data values x j as arising from a Dirich-let process mixture of normals, in addition to modeling the location prior G() as a Dirichlet process itself. This induces a Dirichlet mixture of mixtures of normals, whose analysis may be developed using Gibbs sampling techniques. We discuss these models and their analysis, and illustrate in the context of neurological response analysis."
