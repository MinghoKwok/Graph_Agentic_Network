ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2353 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225746:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Dynamics of Co-evolutionary Learning
Abstract: Co-evolutionary learning, which involves the embedding of adaptive learning agents in a fitness environment which dynamically responds to their progress, is a potential solution for many technological chicken and egg problems, and is at the heart of several recent and surprising successes, such as Sim's artificial robot and Tesauro's backgammon player. We recently solved the two spirals problem, a difficult neural network benchmark classification problem, using the genetic programming primitives set up by [Koza, 1992]. Instead of using absolute fitness, we use a relative fitness [Angeline & Pollack, 1993] based on a competition for coverage of the data set. As the population reproduces, the fitness function driving the selection changes, and subproblem niches are opened, rather than crowded out. The solutions found by our method have a symbiotic structure which suggests that by holding niches open, crossover is better able to discover modular build ing blocks."
