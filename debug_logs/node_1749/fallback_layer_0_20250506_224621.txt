ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1749 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224621:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Algebraic Techniques for Efficient Inference in Bayesian Networks
Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. These algorithms use graph-theoretic techniques to analyze and exploit network topology. In this paper, we examine the problem of efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network as a combinatorial optimization problem, that of finding an optimal factoring given an algebraic expression over a set of probability distributions. We define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and present simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance. We also show how use of an algebraic perspective permits significant extension to the belief net representation."
