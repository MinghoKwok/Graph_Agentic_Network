ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1438 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222956:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning from undiscounted delayed rewards
Abstract: The general framework of reinforcement learning has been proposed by several researchers for both the solution of optimization problems and the realization of adaptive control schemes. To allow for an efficient application of reinforcement learning in either of these areas, it is necessary to solve both the structural and the temporal credit assignment problem. In this paper, we concentrate on the latter which is usually tackled through the use of learning algorithms that employ discounted rewards. We argue that for realistic problems this kind of solution is not satisfactory, since it does not address the effect of noise originating from different experiences and does not allow for an easy explanation of the parameters involved in the learning process. As a possible solution, we propose to keep the delayed reward undiscounted, but to discount the actual adaptation rate. Empirical results show that dependent on the kind of discount used amore stable convergence and even an increase in performance can be obtained."
