ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 997 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220652:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"A Common LISP Hypermedia Server
Abstract: A World-Wide Web (WWW) server was implemented in Common LISP in order to facilitate exploratory programming in the global hypermedia domain and to provide access to complex research programs, particularly artificial intelligence systems. The server was initially used to provide interfaces for document retrieval and for email servers. More advanced applications include interfaces to systems for inductive rule learning and natural-language question answering. Continuing research seeks to more fully generalize automatic form-processing techniques developed for email servers to operate seamlessly over the Web. The conclusions argue that presentation-based interfaces and more sophisticated form processing should be moved into the clients in order to reduce the load on servers and provide more advanced interaction models for users."
