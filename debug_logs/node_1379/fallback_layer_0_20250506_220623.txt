ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1379 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220623:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_1] "The Application of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to the n=m=P=C max Flowshop Problem Abstract: Hard combinatorial problems in sequencing and scheduling..."
2. [Label_1] "A STUDY OF CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING Abstract: Holland's analysis of the sources of power of genetic algorithms has served as guidanc..."
3. [Label_1] "A Search Space Analysis of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem Abstract: A computational study for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem is presented. Thereby e..."
4. [Label_1] "A Genetic Algorithm for File and Task Placement in a Distributed System Abstract: In this paper we explore the distributed file and task placement pro..."
5. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."

Text to classify:
"Modeling Simple Genetic Algorithms for Permutation Problems
Abstract: An exact model of a simple genetic algorithm is developed for permutation based representations. Permutation based representations are used for scheduling problems and combinatorial problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem. A remapping function is developed to remap the model to all permutations in the search space. The mixing matrices for various permutation based operators are also developed."
