ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 544 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214255:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Minimum-Risk Profiles of Protein Families Based on Statistical Decision Theory
Abstract: Statistical decision theory provides a principled way to estimate amino acid frequencies in conserved positions of a protein family. The goal is to minimize the risk function, or the expected squared-error distance between the estimates and the true population frequencies. The minimum-risk estimates are obtained by adding an optimal number of pseudocounts to the observed data. Two formulas are presented, one for pseudocounts based on marginal amino acid frequencies and one for pseudocounts based on the observed data. Experimental results show that profiles constructed using minimal-risk estimates are more discriminating than those constructed using existing methods."
