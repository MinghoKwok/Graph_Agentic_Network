ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1535 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221437:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."
2. [Label_0] "Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and..."
3. [Label_4] "Multi-Time Models for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Reinforcement learning can be used not only to predict rewards, but also to predict states, i.e..."
4. [Label_4] "Analysis of Some Incremental Variants of Policy Iteration: First Steps Toward Understanding Actor-Critic Learning Systems Abstract: Northeastern Unive..."
5. [Label_0] "The Role of Generic Models in Conceptual Change Abstract: 1 This research was funded in part by NSF Grant No. IRI-92-10925 and in part by ONR Grant No..."

Text to classify:
"Decision Models: A Theory of Volitional Explanation
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of motivational analysis, the construction of volitional explanations to describe the planning behavior of agents. We discuss both the content of such explanations, as well as the process by which an understander builds the explanations. Explanations are constructed from decision models, which describe the planning process that an agent goes through when considering whether to perform an action. Decision models are represented as explanation patterns, which are standard patterns of causality based on previous experiences of the understander. We discuss the nature of explanation patterns, their use in representing decision models, and the process by which they are retrieved, used and evaluated."
