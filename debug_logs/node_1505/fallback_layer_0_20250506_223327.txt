ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1505 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223327:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Probably Approximately Optimal Derivation Strategies
Abstract: An inference graph can have many "derivation strategies", each a particular ordering of the steps involved in reducing a given query to a sequence of database retrievals. An "optimal strategy" for a given distribution of queries is a complete strategy whose "expected cost" is minimal, where the expected cost depends on the conditional probabilities that each requested retrieval succeeds, given that a member of this class of queries is posed. This paper describes the PAO algorithm that first uses a set of training examples to approximate these probability values, and then uses these estimates to produce a "probably approximately optimal" strategy | i.e., given any *; ffi &gt; 0, PAO produces a strategy whose cost is within * of the cost of the optimal strategy, with probability greater than 1 ffi. This paper also shows how to obtain these strategies in time polynomial in 1=*, 1=ffi and the size of the inference graph, for many important classes of graphs, including all and-or trees."
