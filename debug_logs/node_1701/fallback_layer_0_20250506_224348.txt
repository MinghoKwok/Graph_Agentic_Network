ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1701 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224348:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Pattern analysis and synthesis in attractor neural networks
Abstract: The representation of hidden variable models by attractor neural networks is studied. Memories are stored in a dynamical attractor that is a continuous manifold of fixed points, as illustrated by linear and nonlinear networks with hidden neurons. Pattern analysis and synthesis are forms of pattern completion by recall of a stored memory. Analysis and synthesis in the linear network are performed by bottom-up and top-down connections. In the nonlinear network, the analysis computation additionally requires rectification nonlinearity and inner product inhibition between hidden neurons. One popular approach to sensory processing is based on generative models, which assume that sensory input patterns are synthesized from some underlying hidden variables. For example, the sounds of speech can be synthesized from a sequence of phonemes, and images of a face can be synthesized from pose and lighting variables. Hidden variables are useful because they constitute a simpler representation of the variables that are visible in the sensory input. Using a generative model for sensory processing requires a method of pattern analysis. Given a sensory input pattern, analysis is the recovery of the hidden variables from which it was synthesized. In other words, analysis and synthesis are inverses of each other. There are a number of approaches to pattern analysis. In analysis-by-synthesis, the synthetic model is embedded inside a negative feedback loop[1]. Another approach is to construct a separate analysis model[2]. This paper explores a third approach, in which visible-hidden pairs are embedded as attractive fixed points, or attractors, in the state space of a recurrent neural network. The attractors can be regarded as memories stored in the network, and analysis and synthesis as forms of pattern completion by recall of a memory. The approach is illustrated with linear and nonlinear network architectures. In both networks, the synthetic model is linear, as in principal"
