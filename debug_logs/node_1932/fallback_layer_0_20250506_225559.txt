ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1932 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225559:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Constrained Optimization for Neural Map Formation: A Unifying Framework for Weight Growth and Normalization
Abstract: Computational models of neural map formation can be considered on at least three different levels of abstraction: detailed models including neural activity dynamics, weight dynamics that abstract from the neural activity dynamics by an adiabatic approximation, and constrained optimization from which equations governing weight dynamics can be derived. Constrained optimization uses an objective function, from which a weight growth rule can be derived as a gradient flow, and some constraints, from which normalization rules are derived. In this paper we present an example of how an optimization problem can be derived from detailed non-linear neural dynamics. A systematic investigation reveals how different weight dynamics introduced previously can be derived from two types of objective function terms and two types of constraints. This includes dynamic link matching as a special case of neural map formation. We focus in particular on the role of coordinate transformations to derive different weight dynamics from the same optimization problem. Several examples illustrate how the constrained optimization framework can help in understanding, generating, and comparing different models of neural map formation. The techniques used in this analysis may also be useful in investigating other types of neural dynamics."
