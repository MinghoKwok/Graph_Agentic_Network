ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2656 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233244:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"ADAPtER: an Integrated Diagnostic System Combining Case-Based and Abductive Reasoning
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to describe the ADAPtER system, a diagnostic architecture combining case-based reasoning with abductive reasoning and exploiting the adaptation of the solution of old episodes, in order to focus the reasoning process. Domain knowledge is represented via a logical model and basic mechanisms, based on abductive reasoning with consistency constraints, have been defined for solving complex diagnostic problems involving multiple faults. The model-based component has been supplemented with a case memory and adaptation mechanisms have been developed, in order to make the diagnostic system able to exploit past experience in solving new cases. A heuristic function is proposed, able to rank the solutions associated to retrieved cases with respect to the adaptation effort needed to transform such solutions into possible solutions for the current case. We will discuss some preliminary experiments showing the validity of the above heuristic and the convenience of solving a new case by adapting a retrieved solution rather than solving the new problem from scratch."
