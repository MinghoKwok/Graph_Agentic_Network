ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1886 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223310:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_2] "Application of Neural Networks for the Classification of Diffuse Liver Disease by Quantitative Echography Abstract: Three different methods were inves..."
2. [Label_2] "Word Perfect Corp. LIA: A Location-Independent Transformation for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2 Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a f..."
3. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
5. [Label_2] "Shattering all sets of k points in "general position" requires (k 1)=2 parameters Abstract: For classes of concepts defined by certain classes of anal..."

Text to classify:
"LU TP 91-4 Self-organizing Networks for Extracting Jet Features
Abstract: Self-organizing neural networks are briefly reviewed and compared with supervised learning algorithms like back-propagation. The power of self-organization networks is in their capability of displaying typical features in a transparent manner. This is successfully demonstrated with two applications from hadronic jet physics; hadronization model discrimination and separation of b,c and light quarks."
