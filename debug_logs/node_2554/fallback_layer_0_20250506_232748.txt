ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2554 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232748:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Genetic Programming Estimates of Kolmogorov Complexity
Abstract: In this paper the problem of the Kolmogorov complexity related to binary strings is faced. We propose a Genetic Programming approach which consists in evolving a population of Lisp programs looking for the optimal program that generates a given string. This evolutionary approach has permited to overcome the intractable space and time difficulties occurring in methods which perform an approximation of the Kolmogorov complexity function. The experimental results are quite significant and also show interesting computational strategies so proving the effectiveness of the implemented technique."
