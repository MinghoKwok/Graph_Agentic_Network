ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2472 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232348:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Toward an Ideal Trainer*
Abstract: This paper appeared in 1994 in Machine Learning, 15 (3): 251-277. Abstract This paper demonstrates how the nature of the opposition during training affects learning to play two-person, perfect information board games. It considers different kinds of competitive training, the impact of trainer error, appropriate metrics for post-training performance measurement, and the ways those metrics can be applied. The results suggest that teaching a program by leading it repeatedly through the same restricted paths, albeit high quality ones, is overly narrow preparation for the variations that appear in real-world experience. The results also demonstrate that variety introduced into training by random choice is unreliable preparation, and that a program that directs its own training may overlook important situations. The results argue for a broad variety of training experience with play at many levels. This variety may either be inherent in the game or introduced deliberately into the training. Lesson and practice training, a blend of expert guidance and knowledge-based, self-directed elaboration, is shown to be particularly effective for learning during competition."
