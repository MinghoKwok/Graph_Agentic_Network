ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2320 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231617:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Inserting the best known bounds for weighted bipar tite matching [11], with 1=2 p polynomial-time
Abstract: we apply the reduction to their two core children, the total sum of their matching weights becomes O(n), and if for each comparison of a spine node and a critical node we apply the reduction to the core child of the spine node, the total sum of their matching weights becomes O(n). With regards to the O( 2 ) comparisons of two critical nodes, their sum cannot exceed O( 2 n) in total weight. Thus, since we have a total of O(n) edges involved in the matchings, in time O(n), we can reduce the total sum of the matching weights to O( 2 n). Theorem 6.6 Let M : IR 1 ! IR be a monotone function bounding the time complexity UWBM. Moreover, let M satisfy that M (x) = x 1+" f(x), where " 0 is a constant, f (x) = O(x o(1) ), f is monotone, and for some constants b 1 ; b 2 , 8x; y b 1 : f(xy) b 2 f (x)f (y). Then, with = " p in time O(n 1+o(1) + M (n)). Proof: We spend O(n polylog n + time(UWBM(k 2 n))) on the matchings. So, by Theorem 5.10, we have that Comp-Core-Trees can be computed in time O(n polylog n + time(UWBM(k 2 n))). Applying Theo 4 = 16, we get Corollary 6.7 MAST is computable in time O(n 1:5 log n).
