ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2309 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232155:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"EVOLVING SENSORS IN ENVIRONMENTS OF CONTROLLED COMPLEXITY
Abstract: 1 . Sensors represent a crucial link between the evolutionary forces shaping a species' relationship with its environment, and the individual's cognitive abilities to behave and learn. We report on experiments using a new class of "latent energy environments" (LEE) models to define environments of carefully controlled complexity which allow us to state bounds for random and optimal behaviors that are independent of strategies for achieving the behaviors. Using LEE's analytic basis for defining environments, we then use neural networks (NNets) to model individuals and a steady - state genetic algorithm to model an evolutionary process shaping the NNets, in particular their sensors. Our experiments consider two types of "contact" and "ambient" sensors, and variants where the NNets are not allowed to learn, learn via error correction from internal prediction, and via reinforcement learning. We find that predictive learning, even when using a larger repertoire of the more sophisticated ambient sensors, provides no advantage over NNets unable to learn. However, reinforcement learning using a small number of crude contact sensors does provide a significant advantage. Our analysis of these results points to a tradeoff between the genetic "robustness" of sensors and their informativeness to a learning system."
