ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1006 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221310:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Learning Probabilistic Automata with Variable Memory Length
Abstract: We propose and analyze a distribution learning algorithm for variable memory length Markov processes. These processes can be described by a subclass of probabilistic finite automata which we name Probabilistic Finite Suffix Automata. The learning algorithm is motivated by real applications in man-machine interaction such as handwriting and speech recognition. Conventionally used fixed memory Markov and hidden Markov models have either severe practical or theoretical drawbacks. Though general hardness results are known for learning distributions generated by sources with similar structure, we prove that our algorithm can indeed efficiently learn distributions generated by our more restricted sources. In Particular, we show that the KL-divergence between the distribution generated by the target source and the distribution generated by our hypothesis can be made small with high confidence in polynomial time and sample complexity. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by learning the structure of natural English text and using our hy pothesis for the correction of corrupted text."
