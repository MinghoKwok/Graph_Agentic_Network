ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1666 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224812:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Probability Density Functions
Abstract: Accurate and fast estimation of probability density functions is crucial for satisfactory computational performance in many scientific problems. When the type of density is known a priori, then the problem becomes statistical estimation of parameters from the observed values. In the non-parametric case, usual estimators make use of kernel functions. If X j ; j = 1; 2; : : : ; n is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with estimated probability density function f n , in the kernel method the computation of the values f n (X 1 ); f n (X 2 ); : : : ; f n (X n ) requires O(n 2 ) operations, since each kernel needs to be evaluated at every X j . We propose a sequence of special weight functions for the non-parametric estimation of f which requires almost linear time: if m is a slowly growing function that increases without bound with n, our method requires only O(m 2 n) arithmetic operations. We derive conditions for convergence under a number of metrics, which turn out to be similar to those required for the convergence of kernel based methods. We also discuss experiments on different distributions and compare the efficiency and the accuracy of our computations with kernel based estimators for various values of n and m."
