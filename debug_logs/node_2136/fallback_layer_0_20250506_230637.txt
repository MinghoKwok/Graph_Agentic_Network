ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2136 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230637:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Bayesian Experimental Design: A Review
Abstract: Non Bayesian experimental design for linear models has been reviewed by Stein-berg and Hunter (1984) and in the recent book by Pukelsheim (1993); Ford, Kitsos and Titterington (1989) reviewed non Bayesian design for nonlinear models. Bayesian design for both linear and nonlinear models is reviewed here. We argue that the design problem is best considered as a decision problem and that it is best solved by maximizing the expected utility of the experiment. This paper considers only in a marginal way, when appropriate, the theory of non Bayesian design."
