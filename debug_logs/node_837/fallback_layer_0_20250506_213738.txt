ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 837 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213738:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_5] "Relational Knowledge Discovery in Databases Abstract: In this paper, we indicate some possible applications of ILP or similar techniques in the knowle..."
2. [Label_5] "Learning by Refining Algorithm Sketches Abstract: In this paper we suggest a mechanism that improves significantly the performance of a top-down induc..."
3. [Label_5] "The Origins of Inductive Logic Programming: A Prehistoric Tale Abstract: This paper traces the development of the main ideas that have led to the pres..."
4. [Label_5] "The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for log..."
5. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."

Text to classify:
"Inductive Database Design
Abstract: When designing a (deductive) database, the designer has to decide for each predicate (or relation) whether it should be defined extensionally or intensionally, and what the definition should look like. An intelligent system is presented to assist the designer in this task. It starts from an example database in which all predicates are defined extensionally. It then tries to compact the database by transforming extensionally defined predicates into intensionally defined ones. The intelligent system employs techniques from the area of inductive logic programming."
