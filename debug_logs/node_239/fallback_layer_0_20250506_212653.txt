ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 239 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212653:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Robust Value Function Approximation by Working Backwards Computing an accurate value function is the key
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the intuition that TD() is meant to operate by approximating asynchronous value iteration. We note that on the important class of discrete acyclic stochastic tasks, value iteration is inefficient compared with the DAG-SP algorithm, which essentially performs only one sweep instead of many by working backwards from the goal. The question we address in this paper is whether there is an analogous algorithm that can be used in large stochastic state spaces requiring function approximation. We present such an algorithm, analyze it, and give comparative results to TD on several domains. the state). Using VI to solve MDPs belonging to either of these special classes can be quite inefficient, since VI performs backups over the entire space, whereas the only backups useful for improving V fl are those on the "frontier" between already-correct and not-yet-correct V fl values. In fact, there are classical algorithms for both problem classes which compute V fl more efficiently by explicitly working backwards: for the deterministic class, Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm; and for the acyclic class, Directed-Acyclic-Graph-Shortest-Paths (DAG-SP) [6]. 1 DAG-SP first topologically sorts the MDP, producing a linear ordering of the states in which every state x precedes all states reachable from x. Then, it runs through that list in reverse, performing one backup per state. Worst-case bounds for VI, Dijkstra, and DAG-SP in deterministic domains with X states and A actions/state are 1 Although [6] presents DAG-SP only for deterministic acyclic problems, it applies straightforwardly to the"
