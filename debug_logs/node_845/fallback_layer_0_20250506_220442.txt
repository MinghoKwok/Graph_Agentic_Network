ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 845 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220442:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Mixture Models in the Exploration of Structure-Activity Relationships in Drug Design
Abstract: We report on a study of mixture modeling problems arising in the assessment of chemical structure-activity relationships in drug design and discovery. Pharmaceutical research laboratories developing test compounds for screening synthesize many related candidate compounds by linking together collections of basic molecular building blocks, known as monomers. These compounds are tested for biological activity, feeding in to screening for further analysis and drug design. The tests also provide data relating compound activity to chemical properties and aspects of the structure of associated monomers, and our focus here is studying such relationships as an aid to future monomer selection. The level of chemical activity of compounds is based on the geometry of chemical binding of test compounds to target binding sites on receptor compounds, but the screening tests are unable to identify binding configurations. Hence potentially critical covari-ate information is missing as a natural latent variable. Resulting statistical models are then mixed with respect to such missing information, so complicating data analysis and inference. This paper reports on a study of a two-monomer, two-binding site framework and associated data. We build structured mixture models that mix linear regression models, predicting chemical effectiveness, with respect to site-binding selection mechanisms. We discuss aspects of modeling and analysis, including problems and pitfalls, and describe results of analyses of a simulated and real data set. In modeling real data, we are led into critical model extensions that introduce hierarchical random effects components to adequately capture heterogeneities in both the site binding mechanisms and in the resulting levels of effectiveness of compounds once bound. Comments on current and potential future directions conclude the report."
