ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2314 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231558:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"GENERAL CLASSES OF CONTROL-LYAPUNOV FUNCTIONS
Abstract: The main result of this paper establishes the equivalence between null asymptotic controllability of nonlinear finite-dimensional control systems and the existence of continuous control-Lyapunov functions (clf's) defined by means of generalized derivatives. In this manner, one obtains a complete characterization of asymptotic controllability, applying in principle to a far wider class of systems than Artstein's Theorem (which relates closed-loop feedback stabilization to the existence of smooth clf's). The proof relies on viability theory and optimal control techniques. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we study systems of the general form"
