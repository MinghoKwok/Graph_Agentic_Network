ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 186 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210551:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Adaptive state space quantisation: adding and removing neurons
Abstract: This paper describes a self-learning control system for a mobile robot. Based on local sensor data, a robot is taught to avoid collisions with obstacles. The only feedback to the control system is a binary-valued external reinforcement signal, which indicates whether or not a collision has occured. A reinforcement learning scheme is used to find a correct mapping from input (sensor) space to output (steering signal) space. An adaptive quantisation scheme is introduced, through which the discrete division of input space is built up from scratch by the system itself."
