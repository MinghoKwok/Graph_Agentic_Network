ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2458 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232909:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"ESTIMATING THE SQUARE ROOT OF A DENSITY VIA COMPACTLY SUPPORTED WAVELETS
Abstract: A large body of nonparametric statistical literature is devoted to density estimation. Overviews are given in Silverman (1986) and Izenman (1991). This paper addresses the problem of univariate density estimation in a novel way. Our approach falls in the class of so called projection estimators, introduced by Cencov (1962). The orthonor-mal basis used is a basis of compactly supported wavelets from Daubechies' family. Kerkyacharian and Picard (1992, 1993), Donoho et al. (1996), and Delyon and Judit-sky (1993), among others, applied wavelets in density estimation. The local nature of wavelet functions makes the wavelet estimator superior to projection estimators that use classical orthonormal bases (Fourier, Hermite, etc.) Instead of estimating the unknown density directly, we estimate the square root of the density, which enables us to control the positiveness and the L 1 norm of the density estimate. However, in that approach one needs a pre-estimator of the density to calculate sample wavelet coefficients. We describe VISUSTOP, a data-driven procedure for determining the maximum number of levels in the wavelet density estimator. Coefficients in the selected levels are thresholded to make the estimator parsimonious."
