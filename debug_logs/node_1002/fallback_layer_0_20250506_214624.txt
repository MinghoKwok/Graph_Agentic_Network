You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

4. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."

"A Model-Based Approach for Supporting Dialogue Inferencing in a Conversational Case-Based Reasoner
Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) is a form of interactive case-based reasoning where users input a partial problem description (in text). The CCBR system responds with a ranked solution display, which lists the solutions of stored cases whose problem descriptions best match the user's, and a ranked question display, which lists the unanswered questions in these cases. Users interact with these displays, either refining their problem description by answering selected questions, or selecting a solution to apply. CCBR systems should support dialogue inferencing; they should infer answers to questions that are implied by the problem description. Otherwise, questions will be listed that the user believes they have already answered. The standard approach to dialogue inferencing allows case library designers to insert rules that define implications between the problem description and unanswered questions. However, this approach imposes substantial knowledge engineering requirements. We introduce an alternative approach whereby an intelligent assistant guides the designer in defining a model of their case library, from which implication rules are derived. We detail this approach, its benefits, and explain how it can be supported through an integration with Parka-DB, a fast relational database system. We will evaluate our approach in the context of our CCBR system, named NaCoDAE. This paper appeared at the 1998 AAAI Spring Symposium on Multimodal Reasoning, and is NCARAI TR AIC-97-023. We introduce an integrated reasoning approach in which a model-based reasoning component performs an important inferencing role in a conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) system named NaCoDAE (Breslow & Aha, 1997) (Figure 1). CCBR is a form of case-based reasoning where users enter text queries describing a problem and the system assists in eliciting refinements of it (Aha & Breslow, 1997). Cases have three components:"
