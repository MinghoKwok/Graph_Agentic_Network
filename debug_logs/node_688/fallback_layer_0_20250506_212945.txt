ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 688 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212945:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Lazy Acquisition of Place Knowledge Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. Our framew..."
2. [Label_4] "Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models Abstract: The close connection between reinforcement learnin..."
3. [Label_4] "Planning by Incremental Dynamic Programming Abstract: This paper presents the basic results and ideas of dynamic programming as they relate most direc..."
4. [Label_4] "Category: Control, Navigation and Planning. Key words: Reinforcement learning, Exploration, Hidden state. Prefer oral presentation. Abstract: This pap..."
5. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."

Text to classify:
"Exploration and Model Building in Mobile Robot Domains
Abstract: I present first results on COLUMBUS, an autonomous mobile robot. COLUMBUS operates in initially unknown, structured environments. Its task is to explore and model the environment efficiently while avoiding collisions with obstacles. COLUMBUS uses an instance-based learning technique for modeling its environment. Real-world experiences are generalized via two artificial neural networks that encode the characteristics of the robot's sensors, as well as the characteristics of typical environments the robot is assumed to face. Once trained, these networks allow for knowledge transfer across different environments the robot will face over its lifetime. COLUMBUS' models represent both the expected reward and the confidence in these expectations. Exploration is achieved by navigating to low confidence regions. An efficient dynamic programming method is employed in background to find minimal-cost paths that, executed by the robot, maximize exploration. COLUMBUS operates in real-time. It has been operating successfully in an office building environment for periods up to hours."
