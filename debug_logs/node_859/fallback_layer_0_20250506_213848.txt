ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 859 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213848:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_4] "Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions Abstract: Machine Learning research has been making great progress is many directions. This article..."
2. [Label_6] "General Bounds on Statistical Query Learning and PAC Learning with Noise via Hypothesis Boosting Abstract: We derive general bounds on the complexity ..."
3. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."
4. [Label_5] "Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of lear..."
5. [Label_6] "On learning hierarchical classifications Abstract: Many significant real-world classification tasks involve a large number of categories which are arr..."

Text to classify:
"On-Site Learning
Abstract: A model for on-site learning is presented. The system learns by querying "hard" patterns while classifying "easy" ones. This model is related to query-based filtering methods, but takes into account that in addition to labelling, filtering through the data has a cost. A few simple policies are introduced and analyzed for a simple problem (1D high low game). In addition the Query-by-Committee algorithm (Seung et. al) is suggested as a good approximator of the model space for real-world domains. Results using this algorithm on a synthesized problem and a real-world OCR task using both a backpropagation network and a nearest neighbor classifier show that an on-site learner can perform as well as a classifier trained off-site, while achieving significant cost reduction."
