ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2318 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225555:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_3] "Analysis of a Non-Reversible Markov Chain Sampler Abstract: Technical Report BU-1385-M, Biometrics Unit, Cornell University Abstract We analyse the co..."
2. [Label_3] "On the Markov Equivalence of Chain Graphs, Undirected Graphs, and Acyclic Digraphs Abstract: Graphical Markov models use undirected graphs (UDGs), acy..."
3. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."
4. [Label_3] "On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular al..."
5. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"EXACT TRANSITION PROBABILITIES FOR THE INDEPENDENCE METROPOLIS SAMPLER
Abstract: A recent result of Jun Liu's has shown how to compute explicitly the eigen-values and eigenvectors for the Markov chain derived from a special case of the Hastings sampling algorithm, known as the indepdendence Metropolis sampler. In this note, we show how to extend the result to obtain exact n-step transition probabilities for any n. This is done first for a chain on a finite state space, and then extended to a general (discrete or continuous) state space. The paper concludes with some implications for diagnostic tests of convergence of Markov chain samplers."
