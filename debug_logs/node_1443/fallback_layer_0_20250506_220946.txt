ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1443 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220946:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_4] "Category: Control, Navigation and Planning. Key words: Reinforcement learning, Exploration, Hidden state. Prefer oral presentation. Abstract: This pap..."

5. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."

Text to classify:
"Residual Q-Learning Applied to Visual Attention
Abstract: Foveal vision features imagers with graded acuity coupled with context sensitive sensor gaze control, analogous to that prevalent throughout vertebrate vision. Foveal vision operates more efficiently than uniform acuity vision because resolution is treated as a dynamically allocatable resource, but requires a more refined visual attention mechanism. We demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves the performance of foveal visual attention, and of the overall vision system, for the task of model based target recognition. A simulated foveal vision system is shown to classify targets with fewer fixations by learning strategies for the acquisition of visual information relevant to the task, and learning how to generalize these strategies in ambiguous and unexpected scenario conditions."
