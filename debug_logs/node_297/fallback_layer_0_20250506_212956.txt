ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 297 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212956:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Automatic Feature Extraction in Machine Learning
Abstract: This thesis presents a machine learning model capable of extracting discrete classes out of continuous valued input features. This is done using a neurally inspired novel competitive classifier (CC) which feeds the discrete classifications forward to a supervised machine learning model. The supervised learning model uses the discrete classifications and perhaps other information available to solve a problem. The supervised learner then generates feedback to guide the CC into potentially more useful classifications of the continuous valued input features. Two supervised learning models are combined with the CC creating ASOCS-AFE and ID3-AFE. Both models are simulated and the results are analyzed. Based on these results, several areas of future research are proposed."
