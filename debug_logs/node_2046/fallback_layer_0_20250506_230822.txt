ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2046 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230822:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 1 examples
- Label_2: 4 examples
- Label_3: 5 examples
- Label_6: 2 examples

Text to classify:
"A Method for Identifying Splice Sites and Translational Start Sites in
Abstract: This paper describes a new method for determining the consensus sequences that signal the start of translation and the boundaries between exons and introns (donor and acceptor sites) in eukaryotic mRNA. The method takes into account the dependencies between adjacent bases, in contrast to the usual technique of considering each position independently. When coupled with a dynamic program to compute the most likely sequence, new consensus sequences emerge. The consensus sequence information is summarized in conditional probability matrices which, when used to locate signals in uncharacter-ized genomic DNA, have greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional matrices. Species-specific versions of these matrices are especially effective at distinguishing true and false sites."
