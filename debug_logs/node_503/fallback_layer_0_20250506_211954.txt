ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 503 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211954:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Generative Learning Structures and Processes for Generalized Connectionist Networks
Abstract: Massively parallel networks of relatively simple computing elements offer an attractive and versatile framework for exploring a variety of learning structures and processes for intelligent systems. This paper briefly summarizes some popular learning structures and processes used in such networks. It outlines a range of potentially more powerful alternatives for pattern-directed inductive learning in such systems. It motivates and develops a class of new learning algorithms for massively parallel networks of simple computing elements. We call this class of learning processes generative for they offer a set of mechanisms for constructive and adaptive determination of the network architecture the number of processing elements and the connectivity among them as a function of experience. Generative learning algorithms attempt to overcome some of the limitations of some approaches to learning in networks that rely on modification of weights on the links within an otherwise fixed network topology e.g., rather slow learning and the need for an a-priori choice of a network architecture. Several alternative designs as well as a range of control structures and processes which can be used to regulate the form and content of internal representations learned by such networks are examined. Empirical results from the study of some generative learning algorithms are briefly summarized and several extensions and refinements of such algorithms, and directions for future research are outlined."
