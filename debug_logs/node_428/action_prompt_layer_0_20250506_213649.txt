ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Action Prompt for Node 428 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213649:

    You are Node 428 in a scientific citation network. Your task is to classify yourself into the correct research category based on your text and connections.
    
    ## Few-shot Examples of Label Prediction:

    Example 1:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "A novel deep learning approach for image classification..."
    2. [Reinforcement_Learning] "Q-learning based algorithm for game playing..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Deep learning models for visual recognition tasks..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: The current text focuses on deep learning and visual recognition, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    Example 2:
    Memory:
    1. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Bayesian networks for uncertainty modeling..."
    2. [Neural_Networks] "Recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction..."
    3. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Markov models for time series analysis..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Hidden Markov models for speech recognition..."

    Prediction: Probabilistic_Methods
    Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models, which is a probabilistic method, matching the Probabilistic_Methods examples in memory.

    Example 3:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "Deep learning architectures for natural language processing..."
    2. [Theory] "Theoretical analysis of algorithm complexity..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Transformer models for sequence modeling..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Attention mechanisms in deep learning models for text understanding..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    "Selective Eager Execution on the PolyPath Architecture
Abstract: Control-flow misprediction penalties are a major impediment to high performance in wide-issue superscalar processors. In this paper we present Selective Eager Execution (SEE), an execution model to overcome mis-speculation penalties by executing both paths after diffident branches. We present the micro-architecture of the PolyPath processor, which is an extension of an aggressive superscalar, out-of-order architecture. The PolyPath architecture uses a novel instruction tagging and register renaming mechanism to execute instructions from multiple paths simultaneously in the same processor pipeline, while retaining maximum resource availability for single-path code sequences. Performance results of our detailed execution-driven, pipeline-level simulations show that the SEE concept achieves a potential average performance improvement of 48% on the SPECint95 benchmarks. A realistic implementation with a dynamic branch confidence estimator can improve performance by as much as 36% for the go benchmark, and an average of 14% on SPECint95, when compared to a normal superscalar, out-of-order, speculative execution, monopath processor. Moreover, our architectural model is both elegant and practical to implement, using a small amount of additional state and control logic."

    - Neighbors with predicted labels: None
    
    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
