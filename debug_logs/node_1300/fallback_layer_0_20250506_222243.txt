ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1300 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222243:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Tempering Backpropagation Networks: Not All Weights are Created Equal approach yields hitherto unparalleled performance on
Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithms typically collapse the network's structure into a single vector of weight parameters to be optimized. We suggest that their performance may be improved by utilizing the structural information instead of discarding it, and introduce a framework for tempering each weight accordingly. In the tempering model, activation and error signals are treated as approximately independent random variables. The characteristic scale of weight changes is then matched to that of the residuals, allowing structural properties such as a node's fan-in and fan-out to affect the local learning rate and backpropagated error. The model also permits calculation of an upper bound on the global learning rate for batch updates, which in turn leads to different update rules for bias vs. non-bias weights."
