ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 941 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220356:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Hyperplane Ranking in Simple Genetic Algorithms
Abstract: We examine the role of hyperplane ranking during search performed by a simple genetic algorithm. We also develop a metric for measuring the degree of ranking that exists with respect to static measurements taken directly from the function, as well as the measurement of dynamic ranking of hyperplanes during genetic search. We show that the degree of dynamic ranking induced by a simple genetic algorithm is highly correlated with the degree of static ranking that is inherent in the function, especially during the initial genera tions of search."
