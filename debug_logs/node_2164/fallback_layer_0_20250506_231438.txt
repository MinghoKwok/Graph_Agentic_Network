ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2164 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231438:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Efficient Inference in Bayes Networks As A Combinatorial Optimization Problem
Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. The techniques used in these algorithms are closely related to network structures and some of them are not easy to understand and implement. In this paper, we consider the problem from the combinatorial optimization point of view and state that efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network is a problem of finding an optimal factoring given a set of probability distributions. From this viewpoint, previously developed algorithms can be seen as alternate factoring strategies. In this paper, we define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and demonstrate simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance."
