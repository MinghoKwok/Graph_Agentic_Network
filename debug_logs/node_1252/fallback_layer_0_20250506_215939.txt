ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1252 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215939:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units Abstract: We propose two algorithms for constructing and traini..."
2. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_5] "Machine Learning and Inference Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches:..."
4. [Label_6] "Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve fi..."
5. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."

Text to classify:
"Constructive Training Methods for Feedforward Neural Networks with Binary Weights
Abstract: DIMACS Technical Report 95-35 August 1995"
