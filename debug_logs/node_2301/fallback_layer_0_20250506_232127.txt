ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2301 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232127:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory Summary:
- Label_0: 7 examples
- Label_3: 2 examples

2. [Label_0] "AN INCREMENTAL LEARNING MODEL FOR COMMONSENSE REASONING Abstract:"
3. [Label_0] "Formalising the knowledge content of case memory systems Abstract: Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a cas..."
4. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."
5. [Label_5] "The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for log..."

Text to classify:
"editors. Representing Preferences as Ceteris Paribus Comparatives
Abstract: Decision-theoretic preferences specify the relative desirability of all possible outcomes of alternative plans. In order to express general patterns of preference holding in a domain, we require a language that can refer directly to preferences over classes of outcomes as well as individuals. We present the basic concepts of a theory of meaning for such generic compar-atives to facilitate their incremental capture and exploitation in automated reasoning systems. Our semantics lifts comparisons of individuals to comparisons of classes "other things being equal" by means of contextual equivalences, equivalence relations among individuals that vary with the context of application. We discuss implications of the theory for represent ing preference information."
