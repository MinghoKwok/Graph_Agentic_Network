ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1851 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225142:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Faster Learning in Multi-Layer Networks by Handling
Abstract: Generalized delta rule, popularly known as back-propagation (BP) [9, 5] is probably one of the most widely used procedures for training multi-layer feed-forward networks of sigmoid units. Despite reports of success on a number of interesting problems, BP can be excruciatingly slow in converging on a set of weights that meet the desired error criterion. Several modifications for improving the learning speed have been proposed in the literature [2, 4, 8, 1, 6]. BP is known to suffer from the phenomenon of flat spots [2]. The slowness of BP is a direct consequence of these flat-spots together with the formulation of the BP Learning rule. This paper proposes a new approach to minimizing the error that is suggested by the mathematical properties of the conventional error function and that effectively handles flat-spots occurring in the output layer. The robustness of the proposed technique is demonstrated on a number of data-sets widely studied in the machine learning community."
