ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2339 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225701:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_5] "Learning by Refining Algorithm Sketches Abstract: In this paper we suggest a mechanism that improves significantly the performance of a top-down induc..."

Text to classify:
"An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming
Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic functions for searching goals to solve problems. The method takes solutions of a problem or a history of search and a set of background knowledge on the problem. In a large class of problems, a problem is described as a set of states and a set of operators, and is solved by finding a series of operators. A solution, a series of operators that brings an initial state to a final state, is transformed into positive and negative examples of a relation "better-choice", which describes that an operator is better than others in a state. We also give a way to use the "better-choice" relation as a heuristic function. The method can use any logic program as background knowledge to induce heuristics, and induced heuristics has high readability. The paper inspects the method by applying to a puzzle."
