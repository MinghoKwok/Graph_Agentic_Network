ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1398 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222750:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Self-Organizing Sets of Experts
Abstract: We describe and evaluate multi-network connectionist systems composed of "expert" networks. By preprocessing training data with a competitive learning network, the system automatically organizes the process of decomposition into expert subtasks. Using several different types of challenging problem, we assess this approach | the degree to which the automatically generated experts really are specialists on a predictable subset of the overall task, and a comparison of such decompositions with equivalent single-networks. In addition, we assess the utility of this approach alongside, and in competition to, non-expert multiversion systems. Previously developed measures of `diversity' for such systems are also applied to provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of specialization obtained in an expert-net ensemble. We show that on both types of problem, abstract well-defined and data-defined, the automatic decomposition does produce an effective set of specialist networks which together can support a high level of performance. Curiously, the study does not provide any support for a differential of effectiveness within the two classes of problem: continuous, homogeneous functions and discrete, discontinuous functions."
