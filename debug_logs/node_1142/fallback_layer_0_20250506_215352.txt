ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1142 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215352:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_1] "A NN Algorithm for Boolean Satisfiability Problems Abstract: Satisfiability (SAT) refers to the task of finding a truth assignment that makes an arbit..."
2. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."
3. [Label_5] "An intelligent search method using Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: We propose a method to use Inductive Logic Programming to give heuristic func..."
4. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
5. [Label_6] "Inductive Logic Programming Abstract: A new research area, Inductive Logic Programming, is presently emerging. While inheriting various positive chara..."

Text to classify:
"A NN Algorithm for Boolean Satisfiability Problems
Abstract: Satisfiability (SAT) refers to the task of finding a truth assignment that makes an arbitrary boolean expression true. This paper compares a neural network algorithm (NNSAT) with GSAT [4], a greedy algorithm for solving satisfiability problems. GSAT can solve problem instances that are difficult for traditional satisfiability algorithms. Results suggest that NNSAT scales better as the number of variables increase, solving at least as many hard SAT problems."
