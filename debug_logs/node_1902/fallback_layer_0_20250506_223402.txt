ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1902 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223402:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units Abstract: We propose two algorithms for constructing and traini..."
2. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
3. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
4. [Label_2] "Tau Net: A Neural Network for Modeling Temporal Variability Abstract: The ability to handle temporal variation is important when dealing with real-wor..."
5. [Label_2] "MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T..."

Text to classify:
"LU TP 91-25 Mass Reconstruction with a Neural Network
Abstract: A feed-forward neural network method is developed for reconstructing the invariant mass of hadronic jets appearing in a calorimeter. The approach is illustrated in W ! q q, where W -bosons are produced in pp reactions at SPS collider energies. The neural network method yields results that are superior to conventional methods. This neural network application differs from the classification ones in the sense that an analog number (the mass) is computed by the network, rather than a binary decision being made. As a by-product our application clearly demonstrates the need for using "intelligent" variables in instances when the amount of training instances is limited."
