ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2397 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232010:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"CuPit-2 A Parallel Language for Neural Algorithms: Language Reference and Tutorial
Abstract: and load balancing even for irregular neural networks. The idea to achieve these goals lies in the programming model: CuPit-2 programs are object-centered, with connections and nodes of a graph (which is the neural network) being the objects. Algorithms are based on parallel local computations in the nodes and connections and communication along the connections (plus broadcast and reduction operations). This report describes the design considerations and the resulting language definition and discusses in detail a tutorial example program. This CuPit-2 language manual and tutorial is an updated version of the original CuPit language manual [Pre94]. The new language CuPit-2 differs from the original CuPit in several ways. All language changes from CuPit to CuPit-2 are listed in the appendix."
