ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2302 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231521:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Genes, Phenes and the Baldwin Effect: Learning and Evolution in a Simulated Population
Abstract: The Baldwin Effect, first proposed in the late nineteenth century, suggests that the course of evolutionary change can be influenced by individually learned behavior. The existence of this effect is still a hotly debated topic. In this paper clear evidence is presented that learning-based plasticity at the phenotypic level can and does produce directed changes at the genotypic level. This research confirms earlier experimental work done by others, notably Hinton & Nowlan (1987). Further, the amount of plasticity of the learned behavior is shown to be crucial to the size of the Baldwin Effect: either too little or too much and the effect disappears or is significantly reduced. Finally, for learnable traits, the case is made that over many generations it will become easier for the population as a whole to learn these traits (i.e. the phenotypic plasticity of these traits will increase). In this gradual transition from a genetically driven population to one driven by learning, the importance of the Baldwin Effect decreases."
