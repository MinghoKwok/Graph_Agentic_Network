ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1684 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222231:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_5] "Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability, Abstract: We compare the per..."
2. [Label_5] "Learning Trees and Rules with Set-valued Features Abstract: In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length "feature vectors", the c..."
3. [Label_6] "Constructing Conjunctions using Systematic Search on Decision Trees Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing con..."
4. [Label_0] "Context-Sensitive Feature Selection for Lazy Learners Abstract:"
5. [Label_6] "Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Relevant Features Abstract: This paper describes efficient methods for exact and approximate implementation of th..."

Text to classify:
"Context-sensitive attribute estimation in regression
Abstract: One of key issues in both discrete and continuous class prediction and in machine learning in general seems to be the problem of estimating the quality of attributes. Heuristic measures mostly assume independence of attributes so their use is non-optimal in domains with strong dependencies between attributes. For the same reason they are also mostly unable to recognize context dependent features. Relief and its extension Re-liefF are statistical methods capable of correctly estimating the quality of attributes in classification problems with strong dependencies between attributes. By exploiting local information provided by different contexts they provide a global view and recognize contextual attributes. After the analysis of ReliefF we have extended it to continuous class problems. Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) and ReliefF provide a unified view on estimating attribute quality. The experiments show that RReliefF correctly estimates the quality of attributes, recognizes the contextual attributes and can be used for non myopic learning of the regression trees."
