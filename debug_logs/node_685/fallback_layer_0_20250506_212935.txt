ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 685 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212935:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:

3. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
4. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."
5. [Label_5] "Abstract Abstract: This paper is a scientific comparison of two code generation techniques with identical goals generation of the best possible softwa..."

Text to classify:
"Performance of the GCel-512 and PowerXPlorer for parallel neural network simulations
Abstract: This report presents new results from work performed in the framework of the IC 3 A pro-gramme. Using the GCel-512 and the PowerXPlorer made available by the UvA, a performance prediction model for several neural network simulations could be validated quantitatively both for a larger processor grid and for a different target parallel processor configuration. The performance prediction model and its application on a popular neural network model | backpropagation | decomposed via network decomposition will be discussed here. Using the model, the suitability of the GCel-512 and PowerXPlorer are discussed in terms of performance, speedup, efficiency and scalability."
