ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2152 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231400:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_1: 7 examples

3. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."

Text to classify:
"Cellular Encoding for Interactive Evolutionary Robotics
Abstract: Research in robotics programming is divided in two camps. The direct hand programmming approach uses an explicit model or a behavioral model ( subsumption architecture). The machine learning community uses neural network and/or genetic algorithm. We claim that hand programming and learning are complementary. The two approaches used together can be orders of magnitude more powerful than each approach taken separately. We propose a method to combine them both. It includes three concepts : syntactic constraints to restrict the search space, hand-made problem decomposition, hand given fitness. We use this method to solve a complex problem ( eight-legged locomotion). It needs 5000 less evaluations compared to when genetic algorithm are used alone."
