ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1828 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223007:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning in Continuous Domains with Delayed Rewards
Abstract: Much has been done to develop learning techniques for delayed reward problems in worlds where the actions and/or states are approximated by discrete representations. Although this is acceptable in some applications there are many more situations where such an approximation is difficult and unnatural. For instance, in applications such as robotic,s where real machines interact with the real world, learning techniques that use real valued continuous quantities are required. Presented in this paper is an extension to Q-learning that uses both real valued states and actions. This is achieved by introducing activation strengths to each actuator system of the robot. This allow all actuators to be active to some continuous amount simultaneously. Learning occurs by incrementally adapting both the expected future reward to goal evaluation function and the gradients of that function with respect to each actuator system."
