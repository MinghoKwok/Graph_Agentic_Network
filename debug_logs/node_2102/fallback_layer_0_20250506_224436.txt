ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2102 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224436:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
4. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."
5. [Label_2] "Theory of Correlations in Stochastic Neural Networks Abstract: One of the main experimental tools in probing the interactions between neurons has been..."

Text to classify:
"The Evolution of Communication Schemes Over Continuous Channels
Abstract: Many problems impede the design of multi-agent systems, not the least of which is the passing of information between agents. While others hand implement communication routes and semantics, we explore a method by which communication can evolve. In the experiments described here, we model agents as connectionist networks. We supply each agent with a number of communications channels implemented by the addition of both input and output units for each channel. The output units initiate environmental signals whose amplitude decay over distance and are perturbed by environmental noise. An agent does not receive input from other individuals, rather the agents input reects the summation of all other agents output signals along that channel. Because we use real-valued activations, the agents communicate using real-valued vectors. Under our evolutionary program, GNARL, the agents coevolve a communication scheme over continuous channels which conveys task-spe cific information."
