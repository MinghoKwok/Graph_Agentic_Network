ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 813 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213622:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"The Application of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to the n=m=P=C max Flowshop Problem
Abstract: Hard combinatorial problems in sequencing and scheduling led recently into further research of genetic algorithms. Canonical coding of the symmetric TSP can be modified into a coding of the n-job m-machine flowshop problem, which configurates the solution space in a different way. We show that well known genetic operators act intelligently on this coding scheme. They implecitely prefer a subset of solutions which contain the probably best solutions with respect to an objective. We conjecture that every new problem needs a determination of this necessary condition for a genetic algorithm to work, i. e. a proof by experiment. We implemented an asynchronous parallel genetic algorithm on a UNIX-based computer network. Computational results of the new heuristic are discussed."
