You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"

4. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."

"Using Neural Networks to Identify Jets
Abstract: A neural network method for identifying the ancestor of a hadron jet is presented. The idea is to find an efficient mapping between certain observed hadronic kinematical variables and the quark/gluon identity. This is done with a neuronic expansion in terms of a network of sigmoidal functions using a gradient descent procedure, where the errors are back-propagated through the network. With this method we are able to separate gluon from quark jets originating from Monte Carlo generated e + e events with ~ 85% accuracy. The result is independent on the MC model used. This approach for isolating the gluon jet is then used to study the so-called string effect. In addition, heavy quarks (b and c) in e + e reactions can be identified on the 50% level by just observing the hadrons. In particular we are able to separate b-quarks with an efficiency and purity, which is comparable with what is expected from vertex detectors. We also speculate on how the neural network method can be used to disentangle different hadronization schemes by compressing the dimensionality of the state space of hadrons."
