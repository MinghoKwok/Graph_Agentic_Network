ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1674 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222200:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
2. [Label_0] "The Role of Generic Models in Conceptual Change Abstract: 1 This research was funded in part by NSF Grant No. IRI-92-10925 and in part by ONR Grant No..."
3. [Label_0] "LINNEO A Classification Methodology for Ill-structured Domains Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover ..."
4. [Label_3] "Abstract Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the..."
5. [Label_5] "A Comparison of Pruning Methods for Relational Concept Learning Abstract: Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning are two standard methods of dealing with noise ..."

Text to classify:
"Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?
Abstract: Judgments of similarity and soundness are important aspects of human analogical processing. This paper explores how these judgments can be modeled using SME, a simulation of Gentner's structure-mapping theory. We focus on structural evaluation, explicating several principles which psychologically plausible algorithms should follow. We introduce the Specificity Conjecture, which claims that naturalistic representations include a preponderance of appearance and low-order information. We demonstrate via computational experiments that this conjecture affects how structural evaluation should be performed, including the choice of normalization technique and how the systematicity preference is implemented."
