    "MultiPlayer Residual Advantage Learning With General Function Approximation
Abstract: A new algorithm, advantage learning, is presented that improves on advantage updating by requiring that a single function be learned rather than two. Furthermore, advantage learning requires only a single type of update, the learning update, while advantage updating requires two different types of updates, a learning update and a normilization update. The reinforcement learning system uses the residual form of advantage learning. An application of reinforcement learning to a Markov game is presented. The testbed has continuous states and nonlinear dynamics. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. On each time step , each player chooses one of two possible actions; turn left or turn right, resulting in a 90 degree instantaneous change in the aircraft s heading. Reinforcement is given only when the missile hits the plane or the plane reaches an escape distance from the missile. The advantage function is stored in a single-hidden-layer sigmoidal network. Speed of learning is increased by a new algorithm , Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD), which extends Jacobs (1988) Delta-Delta for use in incremental training, and differs from Suttons Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (1992) in that it does not require the use of a trace and is amenable for use with general function approximation systems. The advantage learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Empirical results gathered using the missile/aircraft testbed validate theory that suggests residual forms of reinforcement learning algorithms converge to a local minimum of the mean squared Bellman residual when using general function approximation systems. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first time an approximate second order method has been used with residual algorithms. Empirical results are presented comparing convergence rates with and without the use of IDD for the reinforcement learning testbed described above and for a supervised learning testbed. The results of these experiments demonstrate IDD increased the rate of convergence and resulted in an order of magnitude lower total asymptotic error than when using backpropagation alone."
    - Neighbors: [565, 842, 1045, 1118, 1378, 1443, 1459]
    - Available labeled neighbors to retrieve from: None
    - Neighbors with predicted labels: None
    
    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
