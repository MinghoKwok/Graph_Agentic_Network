ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1540 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224128:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"MultiPlayer Residual Advantage Learning With General Function Approximation
Abstract: A new algorithm, advantage learning, is presented that improves on advantage updating by requiring that a single function be learned rather than two. Furthermore, advantage learning requires only a single type of update, the learning update, while advantage updating requires two different types of updates, a learning update and a normilization update. The reinforcement learning system uses the residual form of advantage learning. An application of reinforcement learning to a Markov game is presented. The testbed has continuous states and nonlinear dynamics. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. On each time step , each player chooses one of two possible actions; turn left or turn right, resulting in a 90 degree instantaneous change in the aircraft s heading. Reinforcement is given only when the missile hits the plane or the plane reaches an escape distance from the missile. The advantage function is stored in a single-hidden-layer sigmoidal network. Speed of learning is increased by a new algorithm , Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD), which extends Jacobs (1988) Delta-Delta for use in incremental training, and differs from Suttons Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (1992) in that it does not require the use of a trace and is amenable for use with general function approximation systems. The advantage learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Empirical results gathered using the missile/aircraft testbed validate theory that suggests residual forms of reinforcement learning algorithms converge to a local minimum of the mean squared Bellman residual when using general function approximation systems. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first time an approximate second order method has been used with residual algorithms. Empirical results are presented comparing convergence rates with and without the use of IDD for the reinforcement learning testbed described above and for a supervised learning testbed. The results of these experiments demonstrate IDD increased the rate of convergence and resulted in an order of magnitude lower total asymptotic error than when using backpropagation alone."
