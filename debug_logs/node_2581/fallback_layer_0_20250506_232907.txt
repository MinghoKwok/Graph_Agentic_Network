ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2581 | Layer 0 | 20250506_232907:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_0: 8 examples

2. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
3. [Label_0] "Conceptual Analogy: Conceptual clustering for informed and efficient analogical reasoning Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is a general approach that..."
4. [Label_0] "Modeling Case-based Planning for Repairing Reasoning Failures Abstract: One application of models of reasoning behavior is to allow a reasoner to intr..."

Text to classify:
"Four Challenges for a Computational Model of Legal Precedent
Abstract: Identifying the open research issues in a field is a necessary step for progress in that field. This paper describes four open research problems in computational models of precedent-based legal reasoning: relating case representation to precedent use; modeling the selection and construction of both arguments based on pairwise case comparison and multiple-precedent arguments; modeling the process whereby purposes, policies, and principles are used in case similarity assessment; and extending the applicability of precedents to tasks other than classification."
