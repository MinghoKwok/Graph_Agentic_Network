ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2279 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231406:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Quicknet on MultiSpert: Fast Parallel Neural Network Training
Abstract: The MultiSpert parallel system is a straight-forward extension of the Spert workstation accelerator, which is predominantly used in speech recognition research at ICSI. In order to deliver high performance for Artificial Neural Network training without requiring changes to the user interfaces, the exisiting Quicknet ANN library was modified to run on MultiSpert. In this report, we present the algorithms used in the parallelization of the Quicknet code and analyse their communication and computation requirements. The resulting performance model yields a better understanding of system speed-ups and potential bottlenecks. Experimental results from actual training runs validate the model and demonstrate the achieved performance levels."
