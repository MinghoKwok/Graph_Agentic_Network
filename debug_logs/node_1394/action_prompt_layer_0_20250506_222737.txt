    Current Node Text:
    "Deep learning models for visual recognition tasks..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: The current text focuses on deep learning and visual recognition, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    Current Node Text:
    "Hidden Markov models for speech recognition..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    "Vapnik-Chervonenkis entropy of the spherical perceptron
Abstract: Perceptron learning of randomly labeled patterns is analyzed using a Gibbs distribution on the set of realizable labelings of the patterns. The entropy of this distribution is an extension of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) entropy, reducing to it exactly in the limit of infinite temperature. The close relationship between the VC and Gardner entropies can be seen within the replica formalism. There has been recent progress towards understanding the relationship between the statistical physics and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) approaches to learning theory[1, 2, 3, 4]. The two approaches can be unified in a statistical mechanics based on the VC entropy. This paper treats the case of learning randomly labeled patterns, or the capacity problem, and extends some of the results of previous work[5, 6] to finite temperature. As will be explained in a companion paper, this extension is important for treating the generalization problem, which occurs in the context of learning patterns labeled by a target rule. Our general framework is illustrated for the simple perceptron sgn(w x), which maps an N -dimensional real-valued input x to a 1-valued output. Given a sample X = (x 1 ; : : : ; x m ) of inputs, the weight vector w determines a labeling L = (l 1 ; : : : ; l m ) of the sample via l i = sgn(w x i ). The weight vector w defines a normal hyperplane that separates the positive from the negative examples. The training error of a labeling L with respect to a reference labeling L 0 is defined by 1 m X 1 l i l 0 and is just the fraction of different labels in the two labelings. We consider the case in which the reference labeling is chosen at random, and address the issue of"

    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
