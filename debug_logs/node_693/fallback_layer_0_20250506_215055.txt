ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 693 | Layer 0 | 20250506_215055:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

3. [Label_4] "Improving Policies without Measuring Merits Abstract: Performing policy iteration in dynamic programming should only require knowledge of relative rat..."
4. [Label_2] "MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T..."
5. [Label_6] "Separating Formal Bounds from Practical Performance in Learning Systems Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"FURTHER FACTS ABOUT INPUT TO STATE STABILIZATION "Further facts about input to state stabilization", IEEE
Abstract: Report SYCON-88-15 ABSTRACT Previous results about input to state stabilizability are shown to hold even for systems which are not linear in controls, provided that a more general type of feedback be allowed. Applications to certain stabilization problems and coprime factorizations, as well as comparisons to other results on input to state stability, are also briefly discussed."
