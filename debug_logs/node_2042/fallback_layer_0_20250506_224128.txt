ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2042 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224128:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_2] "Fast Bounded Smooth Regression with Lazy Neural Trees Abstract: We propose the lazy neural tree (LNT) as the appropriate architecture for the realizat..."
2. [Label_3] "Bumptrees for Efficient Function, Constraint, and Classification Learning Abstract: A new class of data structures called bumptrees is described. Thes..."
3. [Label_5] "First Order Regression Abstract: We present a new approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), to handling numerical information in Inductive Logic ..."
4. [Label_4] "Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of TD() for Reinforcement Learning Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) methods constit..."
5. [Label_4] "Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Safely Approximating the Value Function Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, ..."

Text to classify:
"Fast Bounded Smooth Regression with Lazy Neural Trees
Abstract: We propose the lazy neural tree (LNT) as the appropriate architecture for the realization of smooth regression systems. The LNT is a hybrid of a decision tree and a neural network. From the neural network it inherits smoothness of the generated function, incremental adaptability, and conceptual simplicity. From the decision tree it inherits the topology and initial parameter setting as well as a very efficient sequential implementation that out-performs traditional neural network simulations by the order of magnitudes. The enormous speed is achieved by lazy evaluation. A further speed-up can be obtained by the application of a window-ing scheme if the region of interesting results is restricted."
