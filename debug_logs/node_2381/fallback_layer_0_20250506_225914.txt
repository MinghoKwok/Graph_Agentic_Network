ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2381 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225914:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."
3. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
4. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning with Modular Neural Networks for Control Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods can be applied to control problems with the o..."
5. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."

Text to classify:
"Evolving Artificial Neural Networks using the Baldwin Effect
Abstract: This paper describes how through simple means a genetic search towards optimal neural network architectures can be improved, both in the convergence speed as in the quality of the final result. This result can be theoretically explained with the Baldwin effect, which is implemented here not just by the learning process of the network alone, but also by changing the network architecture as part of the learning procedure. This can be seen as a combination of two different techniques, both help ing and improving on simple genetic search."
