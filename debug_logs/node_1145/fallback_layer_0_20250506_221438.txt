ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1145 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221438:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Unifying View of Some Training Algorithms for Multilayer Perceptrons with FIR Filter Synapses
Abstract: Recent interest has come about in deriving various neural network architectures for modelling time-dependent signals. A number of algorithms have been published for multilayer perceptrons with synapses described by finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters (the latter case is also known as Locally Recurrent Globally Feedforward Networks). The derivations of these algorithms have used different approaches in calculating the gradients, and in this note, we present a short, but unifying account of how these different algorithms compare for the FIR case, both in derivation, and performance. New algorithms are subsequently presented. Simulation results have been performed to benchmark these algorithms. In this note, results are compared for the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series against a number of other methods including a standard multilayer perceptron, and a local approximation method."
