ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2556 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230839:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_4] "Towards a Reactive Critic Abstract: In this paper we propose a reactive critic, that is able to respond to changing situations. We will explain why th..."
2. [Label_0] "A Comparative Utility Analysis of Case-Based Reasoning and Control-Rule Learning Systems Abstract: The utility problem in learning systems occurs when..."
3. [Label_4] "Planning by Incremental Dynamic Programming Abstract: This paper presents the basic results and ideas of dynamic programming as they relate most direc..."
4. [Label_0] "Observation and Generalisation in a Simulated Robot World Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulat..."
5. [Label_4] "Emergent Hierarchical Control Structures: Learning Reactive/Hierarchical Relationships in Reinforcement Environments Abstract: The use of externally i..."

Text to classify:
"A Case-Based Approach to Reactive Control for Autonomous Robots
Abstract: We propose a case-based method of selecting behavior sets as an addition to traditional reactive robotic control systems. The new system (ACBARR | A Case BAsed Reactive Robotic system) provides more flexible performance in novel environments, as well as overcoming a standard "hard" problem for reactive systems, the box canyon. Additionally, ACBARR is designed in a manner which is intended to remain as close to pure reactive control as possible. Higher level reasoning and memory functions are intentionally kept to a minimum. As a result, the new reasoning does not significantly slow the system down from pure reactive speeds."
