ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 973 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220537:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Interval Censored Survival Data: A Review of Recent Progress
Abstract: We review estimation in interval censoring models, including nonparametric estimation of a distribution function and estimation of regression models. In the non-parametric setting, we describe computational procedures and asymptotic properties of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators. In the regression setting, we focus on the proportional hazards, the proportional odds and the accelerated failure time semiparametric regression models. Particular emphasis is given to calculation of the Fisher information for the regression parameters. We also discuss computation of the regression parameter estimators via profile likelihood or maximization of the semi-parametric likelihood, distributional results for the maximum likelihood estimators, and estimation of (asymptotic) variances. Some further problems and open questions are also reviewed."
