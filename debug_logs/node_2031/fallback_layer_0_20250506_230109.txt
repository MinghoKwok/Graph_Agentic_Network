ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2031 | Layer 0 | 20250506_230109:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"TOWARDS CONCEPT FORMATION GROUNDED ON PERCEPTION AND ACTION OF A MOBILE ROBOT
Abstract: The recognition of objects and, hence, their descriptions must be grounded in the environment in terms of sensor data. We argue, why the concepts, used to classify perceived objects and used to perform actions on these objects, should integrate action-oriented perceptual features and perception-oriented action features. We present a grounded symbolic representation for these concepts. Moreover, the concepts should be learned. We show a logic-oriented approach to learning grounded concepts."
