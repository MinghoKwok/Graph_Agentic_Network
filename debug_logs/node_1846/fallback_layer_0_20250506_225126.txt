ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1846 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225126:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Neural Network Architecture for High-Speed Database Query Processing
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANN), due to their inherent parallelism and potential fault tolerance, offer an attractive paradigm for robust and efficient implementations of large modern database and knowledge base systems. This paper explores a neural network model for efficient implementation of a database query system. The application of the proposed model to a high-speed library query system for retrieval of multiple items is based on partial match of the specified query criteria with the stored records. The performance of the ANN realization of the database query module is analyzed and compared with other techniques commonly in current computer systems. The results of this analysis suggest that the proposed ANN design offers an attractive approach for the realization of query modules in large database and knowledge base systems, especially for retrieval based on partial matches."
