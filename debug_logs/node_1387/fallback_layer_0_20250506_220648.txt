ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1387 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220648:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Theory of Correlations in Stochastic Neural Networks Abstract: One of the main experimental tools in probing the interactions between neurons has been..."
2. [Label_2] "Modeling Cortical Plasticity Based on Adapting Lateral Interaction Abstract: A neural network model called LISSOM for the cooperative self-organizatio..."
3. [Label_2] "Separating hippocampal maps  Spatial Functions of the Hippocampal Formation and the Abstract: The place fields of hippocampal cells in old animals som..."
4. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_1] "Environmental Effects on Minimal Behaviors in the Minimat World Abstract: The structure of an environment affects the behaviors of the organisms that ..."

Text to classify:
"Cortical activity flips among quasi stationary states
Abstract: M. Abeles, H. Bergman and E. Vaadia, School of Medicine and Center for Neural Computation Hebrew University, POB 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Is-rael. E. Seidemann and I.
