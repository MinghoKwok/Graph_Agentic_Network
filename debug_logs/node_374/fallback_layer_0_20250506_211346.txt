ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 374 | Layer 0 | 20250506_211346:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"An Introspection Approach to Querying a Trainer
Abstract: Technical Report 96-13 January 22, 1996 Abstract This paper introduces the Introspection Approach, a method by which a learning agent employing reinforcement learning can decide when to ask a training agent for instruction. When using our approach, we find that the same number of trainer's responses produced significantly faster learners than by having the learner ask for aid randomly. Guidance received via our approach is more informative than random guidance. Thus, we can reduce the interaction that the training agent has with the learning agent without reducing the speed with which the learner develops its policy. In fact, by being intelligent about when the learner asks for help, we can even increase the learning speed for the same level of trainer interaction."
