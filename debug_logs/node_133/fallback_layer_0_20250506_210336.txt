ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 133 | Layer 0 | 20250506_210336:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

2. [Label_6] "Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acqui..."
3. [Label_5] "Incremental Reduced Error Pruning Abstract: This paper outlines some problems that may occur with Reduced Error Pruning in relational learning algorit..."
4. [Label_3] "Bumptrees for Efficient Function, Constraint, and Classification Learning Abstract: A new class of data structures called bumptrees is described. Thes..."

Text to classify:
"PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE CREATION OF "VIRTUAL" EXAMPLES FOR RBF NETWORKS 1
Abstract: We consider the problem of how to incorporate prior knowledge in supervised learning techniques. We set the problem in the framework of regularization theory, and consider the case in which we know that the approximated function has radial symmetry. The problem can be solved in two alternative ways: 1) use the invariance as a constraint in the regularization theory framework to derive a rotation invariant version of Radial Basis Functions; 2) use the radial symmetry to create new, "virtual" examples from a given data set. We show that these two apparently different methods of learning from "hints" (Abu-Mostafa, 1993) lead to exactly the same analyt ical solution."
