ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2365 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225824:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

1. [Label_5] "Abstract Abstract: This paper is a scientific comparison of two code generation techniques with identical goals generation of the best possible softwa..."
2. [Label_5] "THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split..."
3. [Label_1] "17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the nee..."
4. [Label_2] "ce: [Tex89] <institution> Texas Instruments. </institution> <note> TMS320C30 C Compiler Reference Guide, 1989. Document Title: SPRU034A. </note> Abstr..."
5. [Label_1] "The Application of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to the n=m=P=C max Flowshop Problem Abstract: Hard combinatorial problems in sequencing and scheduling..."

Text to classify:
"A Reduced Multipipeline Machine Description that Preserves Scheduling Constraints
Abstract: High performance compilers increasingly rely on accurate modeling of the machine resources to efficiently exploit the instruction level parallelism of an application. In this paper, we propose a reduced machine description that results in faster detection of resource contentions while preserving the scheduling constraints present in the original machine description. The proposed approach reduces a machine description in an automated, error-free, and efficient fashion. Moreover, it fully supports schedulers that backtrack and process operations in arbitrary order. Reduced descriptions for the DEC Alpha 21064, MIPS R3000/R3010, and Cydra 5 result in 4 to 7 times faster detection of resource contentions and require 22 to 90% of the memory storage used by the original machine descriptions."
