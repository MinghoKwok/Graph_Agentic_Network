ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 313 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213046:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The Case for Graph-Structured Representations
Abstract: Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific pieces of experience, the reasoner's or another's, that can be used to solve problems. We use the term "graph-structured" for representations that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case, and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some logic. We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations efficiently. We make a "case-based argument" using examples from two systems, chiron and caper, to show how a graph-structured representation supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, imple mented in caper."
