ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1481 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221145:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_1] "ADAPTIVE TESTING OF CONTROLLERS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to main..."
2. [Label_1] "An Artificial Life Model for Investigating the Evolution of Modularity Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we pres..."
3. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."
4. [Label_0] "Observation and Generalisation in a Simulated Robot World Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulat..."
5. [Label_1] "Incremental Co-evolution of Organisms: A New Approach for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine ..."

Text to classify:
"An Evolutionary Approach to Learning in Robots
Abstract: Evolutionary learning methods have been found to be useful in several areas in the development of intelligent robots. In the approach described here, evolutionary algorithms are used to explore alternative robot behaviors within a simulation model as a way of reducing the overall knowledge engineering effort. This paper presents some initial results of applying the SAMUEL genetic learning system to a collision avoidance and navigation task for mobile robots."
