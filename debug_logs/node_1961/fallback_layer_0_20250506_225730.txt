ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1961 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225730:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Resource Spackling: A Framework for Integrating Register Allocation in Local and Global Schedulers
Abstract: We present Resource Spackling, a framework for integrating register allocation and instruction scheduling that is based on a Measure and Reduce paradigm. The technique measures the resource requirements of a program and uses the measurements to distribute code for better resource allocation. The technique is applicable to the allocation of different types of resources. A program's resource requirements for both register and functional unit resources are first measured using a unified representation. These measurements are used to find areas where resources are either under or over utilized, called resource holes and excessive sets, respectively. Conditions are determined for increasing resource utilization in the resource holes. These conditions are applicable to both local and global code motion."
