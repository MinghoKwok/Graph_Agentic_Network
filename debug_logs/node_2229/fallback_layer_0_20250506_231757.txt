ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2229 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231757:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

- Label_0: 1 examples

Text to classify:
"Bottom-up induction of logic programs with more than one recursive clause
Abstract: In this paper we present a bottom-up algorithm called MRI to induce logic programs from their examples. This method can induce programs with a base clause and more than one recursive clause from a very small number of examples. MRI is based on the analysis of saturations of examples. It first generates a path structure, which is an expression of a stream of values processed by predicates. The concept of path structure was originally introduced by Identam-Almquist and used in TIM [ Idestam-Almquist, 1996 ] . In this paper, we introduce the concepts of extension and difference of path structure. Recursive clauses can be expressed as a difference between a path structure and its extension. The paper presents the algorithm and shows experimental results obtained by the method."
