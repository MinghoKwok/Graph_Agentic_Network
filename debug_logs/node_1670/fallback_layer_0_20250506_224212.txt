ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1670 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224212:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Raising GA Performance by Simultaneous Tuning of Selective Pressure and Recombination Disruptiveness
Abstract: In many Genetic Algorithms applications the objective is to find a (near-)optimal solution using a limited amount of computation. Given these requirements it is difficult to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Usually such a balance is found by tuning the various parameters (like the selective pressure, population size, the mutation- and crossover rate) of the Genetic Algorithm. As an alternative we propose simultaneous tuning of the selective pressure and the disruptiveness of the recombination operators. Our experiments show that the combination of a proper selective pressure and a highly disruptive recombination operator yields superior performance. The reduction mechanism used in a Steady-State GA has a strong influence on the optimal crossover disruptiveness. Using the worst fitness deletion strategy the building blocks present in the current best individuals are always preserved. This releases the crossover operator from the burden to maintain good building blocks and allows us to tune crossover disruptiveness to improve the search for better individuals."
