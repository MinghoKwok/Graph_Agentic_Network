ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Action Prompt for Node 568 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214412:

    You are Node 568 in a scientific citation network. Your task is to classify yourself into the correct research category based on your text and connections.
    
    ## Few-shot Examples of Label Prediction:

    Example 1:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "A novel deep learning approach for image classification..."
    2. [Reinforcement_Learning] "Q-learning based algorithm for game playing..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Deep learning models for visual recognition tasks..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: The current text focuses on deep learning and visual recognition, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    Example 2:
    Memory:
    1. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Bayesian networks for uncertainty modeling..."
    2. [Neural_Networks] "Recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction..."
    3. [Probabilistic_Methods] "Markov models for time series analysis..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Hidden Markov models for speech recognition..."

    Prediction: Probabilistic_Methods
    Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models, which is a probabilistic method, matching the Probabilistic_Methods examples in memory.

    Example 3:
    Memory:
    1. [Neural_Networks] "Deep learning architectures for natural language processing..."
    2. [Theory] "Theoretical analysis of algorithm complexity..."
    3. [Neural_Networks] "Transformer models for sequence modeling..."

    Current Node Text:
    "Attention mechanisms in deep learning models for text understanding..."

    Prediction: Neural_Networks
    Reasoning: Although the text mentions theoretical concepts like attention mechanisms, the focus is on deep learning models and their application to text understanding, which closely matches the Neural_Networks examples in memory.

    "Online Learning with Random Representations
Abstract: We consider the requirements of online learning|learning which must be done incrementally and in realtime, with the results of learning available soon after each new example is acquired. Despite the abundance of methods for learning from examples, there are few that can be used effectively for online learning, e.g., as components of reinforcement learning systems. Most of these few, including radial basis functions, CMACs, Ko-honen's self-organizing maps, and those developed in this paper, share the same structure. All expand the original input representation into a higher dimensional representation in an unsupervised way, and then map that representation to the final answer using a relatively simple supervised learner, such as a perceptron or LMS rule. Such structures learn very rapidly and reliably, but have been thought either to scale poorly or to require extensive domain knowledge. To the contrary, some researchers (Rosenblatt, 1962; Gallant & Smith, 1987; Kanerva, 1988; Prager & Fallside, 1988) have argued that the expanded representation can be chosen largely at random with good results. The main contribution of this paper is to develop and test this hypothesis. We show that simple random-representation methods can perform as well as nearest-neighbor methods (while being more suited to online learning), and significantly better than backpropagation. We find that the size of the random representation does increase with the dimensionality of the problem, but not unreasonably so, and that the required size can be reduced substantially using unsupervised-learning techniques. Our results suggest that randomness has a useful role to play in online supervised learning and constructive induction."
    - Neighbors: [478, 843]
    - Available labeled neighbors to retrieve from: None
    - Neighbors with predicted labels: None
    
    You are an autonomous agent with planning capabilities. You may perform multiple actions in sequence to achieve better results.

    ## Decide Your Next Action(s)
    Important: You are allowed and encouraged to return MULTIPLE actions in sequence. You MUST respond with a JSON array even if there's only one action. 
    Example of a valid response:
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"},
      {"action_type": "broadcast"}
    ]
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [1, 2, 3], "info_type": "text"},
      {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": "machine learning", "top_k": 10}
    ]
    ```
    Invalid response:
    ```json
    {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": "Neural_Networks"}
    ```

    ### Available Actions:

    1. "retrieve": get information from other nodes
    - Format: {"action_type": "retrieve", "target_nodes": [IDs], "info_type": "text"}

    2. "broadcast": send a message to neighbors if and *only* if you already have a label or predicted label
    - Format: {"action_type": "broadcast", "target_nodes": [IDs], "message": "some message"}
    - Use this *only* when you already have a label orpredicted label to share it with neighbors. 
    - You MUST NOT use "broadcast" unless you already have a label orpredicted label (i.e., after an "update" action).
    - So "update" action always works before "broadcast" in the same layer.

    
        3. "update": decide your label *only* when the memory has enough information(labeled nodes, with text and label)
        - Format: {"action_type": "update", "predicted_label": choose one of allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5", "Label_6"]}
        - You MUST choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed.
        - You MUST base your decision only on the definitions of the labels and the memory nodes with known labels.
        - You should ALWAYS follow this action with a "broadcast" to share your label with neighbors.

    4. "rag_query": search globally for similar labeled nodes, can make up "retrieve" action
    - Format: {"action_type": "rag_query", "query": [Your node ID, e.g. 13/57], "top_k": number of nodes to retrieve}
    - Use this when you don't have enough informative neighbors or memory, and need global examples.
    - You must use your own node ID as the query.

    5. "no_op": take no action
    - Format: {"action_type": "no_op"}

    

    ## Planning Your Steps
    1. If you have a predicted label, you can choose to broadcast it or continue to retrieve nodes with labels.
    2. If you don't have a predicted label, think like a planner: first gather evidence (retrieve, rag_query), then make a decision (update), and finally help others (broadcast).
    Think about the following:
    - If you cannot predict your label yet, need more context to predict your label â†’ `retrieve`, `rag_query`
    - Are you confident to predict your label? â†’ `update`
    - Have you shared your label or predicted label with neighbors? â†’ `broadcast`
    - Only broadcast if you have a predicted label or training label, AND your memory is not empty. If not, choose "retrieve" or "rag_query" first.
    - If any neighbors already have predicted labels, it is recommended to retrieve from them first.
