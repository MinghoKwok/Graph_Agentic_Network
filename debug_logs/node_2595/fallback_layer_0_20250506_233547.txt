ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2595 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233547:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"TO IMPROVE FORECASTING
Abstract: Working Paper IS-97-007, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. In: Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance 6 (1998) 14-23. (Special Issue on "Improving Generalization of Nonlinear Financial Forecasting Models".) http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~aweigend/Research/Papers/InteractionLayer Abstract. Predictive models for financial data are often based on a large number of plausible inputs that are potentially nonlinearly combined to yield the conditional expectation of a target, such as a daily return of an asset. This paper introduces a new architecture for this task: On the output side, we predict dynamical variables such as first derivatives and curvatures on different time spans. These are subsequently combined in an interaction output layer to form several estimates of the variable of interest. Those estimates are then averaged to yield the final prediction. Independently from this idea, on the input side, we propose a new internal preprocessing layer connected with a diagonal matrix of positive weights to a layer of squashing functions. These weights adapt for each input individually and learn to squash outliers in the input. We apply these two ideas to the real world example of the daily predictions of the German stock index DAX (Deutscher Aktien Index), and compare the results to a network with a single output. The new six layer architecture is more stable in training due to two facts: (1) More information is flowing back from the outputs to the input in the backward pass; (2) The constraint of predicting first and second derivatives focuses the learning on the relevant variables for the dynamics. The architectures are compared from both the training perspective (squared errors, robust errors), and from the trading perspective (annualized returns, percent correct, Sharpe ratio)."
