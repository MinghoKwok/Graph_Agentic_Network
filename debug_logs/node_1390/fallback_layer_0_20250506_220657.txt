ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1390 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220657:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

3. [Label_6] "An Interactive Model of Teaching Abstract: Previous teaching models in the learning theory community have been batch models. That is, in these models ..."
4. [Label_4] "Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learn..."
5. [Label_4] "A Teaching Strategy for Memory-Based Control Abstract: Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above a..."

"Learning Finite Automata Using Local Distinguishing Experiments
Abstract: One of the open problems listed in [ Rivest and Schapire, 1989 ] is whether and how that the copies of L fl in their algorithm can be combined into one for better performance. This paper describes an algorithm called D fl that does that combination. The idea is to represent the states of the learned model using observable symbols as well as hidden symbols that are constructed during learning. These hidden symbols are created to reflect the distinct behaviors of the model states. The distinct behaviors are represented as local distinguishing experiments (LDEs) (not to be confused with global distinguishing sequences), and these LDEs are created when the learner's prediction mismatches the actual observation from the unknown machine. To synchronize the model with the environment, these LDEs can also be concatenated to form a homing sequence. It can be shown that D fl can learn, with probability 1 , a model that is an *-approximation of the unknown machine, in a number of actions polynomial in the size of the environment and"
