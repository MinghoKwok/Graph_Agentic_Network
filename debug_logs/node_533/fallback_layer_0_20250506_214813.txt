ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 533 | Layer 0 | 20250506_214813:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:

Text to classify:
"Estimating Ratios of Normalizing Constants for Densities with Different Dimensions
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, a Bayes factor is defined as the ratio of posterior odds versus prior odds where posterior odds is simply a ratio of the normalizing constants of two posterior densities. In many practical problems, the two posteriors have different dimensions. For such cases, the current Monte Carlo methods such as the bridge sampling method (Meng and Wong 1996), the path sampling method (Gelman and Meng 1994), and the ratio importance sampling method (Chen and Shao 1994) cannot directly be applied. In this article, we extend importance sampling, bridge sampling, and ratio importance sampling to problems of different dimensions. Then we find global optimal importance sampling, bridge sampling, and ratio importance sampling in the sense of minimizing asymptotic relative mean-square errors of estimators. Implementation algorithms, which can asymptotically achieve the optimal simulation errors, are developed and two illustrative examples are also provided."
