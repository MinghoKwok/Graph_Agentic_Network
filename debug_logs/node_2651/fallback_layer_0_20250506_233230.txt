ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2651 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233230:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Relative Loss Bounds for Multidimensional Regression Problems
Abstract: We study on-line generalized linear regression with multidimensional outputs, i.e., neural networks with multiple output nodes but no hidden nodes. We allow at the final layer transfer functions such as the softmax function that need to consider the linear activations to all the output neurons. We also use a parameterization function which transforms parameter vectors maintained by the algorithm into the actual weights. The on-line algorithm we consider updates the parameters in an additive manner, analogous to the delta rule, but because the actual weights are obtained via the possibly nonlinear parameterization function they may behave in a very different manner. Our approach is based on applying the notion of a matching loss function in two different contexts. First, we measure the loss of the algorithm in terms of the loss that matches the transfer function used to produce the outputs. Second, the loss function that matches the parameterization function can be used both as a measure of distance between models in motivating the update rule of the algorithm and as a potential function in analyzing its relative performance compared to an arbitrary fixed model. As a result, we have a unified treatment that generalizes earlier results for the gradient descent and exponentiated gradient algorithms to multidimensional outputs, including multiclass logistic regression."
