ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1895 | Layer 0 | 20250506_223340:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units Abstract: We propose two algorithms for constructing and traini..."
2. [Label_6] "Machine Learning by Function Decomposition Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a defini..."
3. [Label_2] "Learning Symbolic Rules Using Artificial Neural Networks Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural network..."
4. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."
5. [Label_1] "Growing neural networks Abstract: nan"

Text to classify:
"Generating Neural Networks Through the Induction of Threshold Logic Unit Trees (Extended Abstract)
Abstract: We investigate the generation of neural networks through the induction of binary trees of threshold logic units (TLUs). Initially, we describe the framework for our tree construction algorithm and how such trees can be transformed into an isomorphic neural network topology. Several methods for learning the linear discriminant functions at each node of the tree structure are examined and shown to produce accuracy results that are comparable to classical information theoretic methods for constructing decision trees (which use single feature tests at each node). Our TLU trees, however, are smaller and thus easier to understand. Moreover, we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn both the topology and weight settings of a neural network simply using the training data set that we are given."
