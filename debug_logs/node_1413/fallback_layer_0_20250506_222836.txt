ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1413 | Layer 0 | 20250506_222836:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Abstract: ASSERT demonstrates how theory refinement techniques developed in machine learning can be used to ef fec-tively build student models for intelligent tutoring systems. This application is unique since it inverts the normal goal of theory refinement from correcting errors in a knowledge base to introducing them. A comprehensive experiment involving a lar ge number of students interacting with an automated tutor for teaching concepts in C ++ programming was used to evaluate the approach. This experiment demonstrated the ability of theory refinement to generate more accurate student models than raw induction, as well as the ability of the resulting models to support individualized feedback that actually improves students subsequent performance.
