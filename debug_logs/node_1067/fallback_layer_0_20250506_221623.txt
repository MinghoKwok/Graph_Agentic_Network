ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1067 | Layer 0 | 20250506_221623:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Fast Fixed-Point Algorithm for Independent Component Analysis
Abstract: This paper will appear in Neural Computation, 9:1483-1492, 1997. Abstract We introduce a novel fast algorithm for Independent Component Analysis, which can be used for blind source separation and feature extraction. It is shown how a neural network learning rule can be transformed into a txed-point iteration, which provides an algorithm that is very simple, does not depend on any user-detned parameters, and is fast to converge to the most accurate solution allowed by the data. The algorithm tnds, one at a time, all non-Gaussian independent components, regardless of their probability distributions. The computations can be performed either in batch mode or in a semi-adaptive manner. The convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proven, and the convergence speed is shown to be cubic. Some comparisons to gradient based algorithms are made, showing that the new algorithm is usually 10 to 100 times faster, sometimes giving the solution in just a few iterations."
