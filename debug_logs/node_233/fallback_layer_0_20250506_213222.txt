ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 233 | Layer 0 | 20250506_213222:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A `SELF-REFERENTIAL' WEIGHT MATRIX
Abstract: Weight modifications in traditional neural nets are computed by hard-wired algorithms. Without exception, all previous weight change algorithms have many specific limitations. Is it (in principle) possible to overcome limitations of hard-wired algorithms by allowing neural nets to run and improve their own weight change algorithms? This paper constructively demonstrates that the answer (in principle) is `yes'. I derive an initial gradient-based sequence learning algorithm for a `self-referential' recurrent network that can `speak' about its own weight matrix in terms of activations. It uses some of its input and output units for observing its own errors and for explicitly analyzing and modifying its own weight matrix, including those parts of the weight matrix responsible for analyzing and modifying the weight matrix. The result is the first `introspective' neural net with explicit potential control over all of its own adaptive parameters. A disadvantage of the algorithm is its high computational complexity per time step which is independent of the sequence length and equals O(n conn logn conn ), where n conn is the number of connections. Another disadvantage is the high number of local minima of the unusually complex error surface. The purpose of this paper, however, is not to come up with the most efficient `introspective' or `self-referential' weight change algorithm, but to show that such algorithms are possible at all."
