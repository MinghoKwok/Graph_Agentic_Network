ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2109 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224457:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

## Your Turn:
Memory:
1. [Label_6] "On learning hierarchical classifications Abstract: Many significant real-world classification tasks involve a large number of categories which are arr..."
2. [Label_5] "Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on Abstract: This paper tackles the supe..."
3. [Label_3] "Logarithmic Time Parallel Bayesian Inference Abstract: I present a parallel algorithm for exact probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. For poly..."
4. [Label_1] "Genetic Algorithms For Vertex Splitting in DAGs 1 Abstract: 1 This paper has been submitted to the 5th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms ..."
5. [Label_6] "Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic? Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | ..."

Text to classify:
"Local quartet splits of a binary tree infer all quartet splits via one dyadic inference
Abstract: DIMACS Technical Report 96-43 DIMACS is a partnership of Rutgers University, Princeton University, AT&T Research, Bellcore, and Bell Laboratories. DIMACS is an NSF Science and Technology Center, funded under contract STC-91-19999; and also receives support from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology."
