ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2362 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225814:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

2. [Label_3] "Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related ..."

4. [Label_6] "Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models Abstract: nan"
5. [Label_3] "Monte Carlo Implementation of Gaussian Process Models for Bayesian Regression and Classification Abstract: Technical Report No. 9702, Department of St..."

Text to classify:
"Outperforming the Gibbs sampler empirical estimator for nearest neighbor random fields
Abstract: Given a Markov chain sampling scheme, does the standard empirical estimator make best use of the data? We show that this is not so and construct better estimators. We restrict attention to nearest neighbor random fields and to Gibbs samplers with deterministic sweep, but our approach applies to any sampler that uses reversible variable-at-a-time updating with deterministic sweep. The structure of the transition distribution of the sampler is exploited to construct further empirical estimators that are combined with the standard empirical estimator to reduce asymptotic variance. The extra computational cost is negligible. When the random field is spatially homogeneous, symmetrizations of our estimator lead to further variance reduction. The performance of the estimators is evaluated in a simulation study of the Ising model."
