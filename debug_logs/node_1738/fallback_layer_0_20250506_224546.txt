ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1738 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224546:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Evolving nonTrivial Behaviors on Real Robots: an Autonomous Robot that Picks up Objects
Abstract: Recently, a new approach that involves a form of simulated evolution has been proposed for the building of autonomous robots. However, it is still not clear if this approach may be adequate to face real life problems. In this paper we show how control systems that perform a nontrivial sequence of behaviors can be obtained with this methodology by carefully designing the conditions in which the evolutionary process operates. In the experiment described in the paper, a mobile robot is trained to locate, recognize, and grasp a target object. The controller of the robot has been evolved in simulation and then downloaded and tested on the real robot."
