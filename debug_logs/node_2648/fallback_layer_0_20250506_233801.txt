ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2648 | Layer 0 | 20250506_233801:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"The Task Rehearsal Method of Sequential Learning
Abstract: An hypothesis of functional transfer of task knowledge is presented that requires the development of a measure of task relatedness and a method of sequential learning. The task rehearsal method (TRM) is introduced to address the issues of sequential learning, namely retention and transfer of knowledge. TRM is a knowledge based inductive learning system that uses functional domain knowledge as a source of inductive bias. The representations of successfully learned tasks are stored within domain knowledge. Virtual examples generated by domain knowledge are rehearsed in parallel with the each new task using either the standard multiple task learning (MTL) or the MTL neural network methods. The results of experiments conducted on a synthetic domain of seven tasks demonstrate the method's ability to retain and transfer task knowledge. TRM is shown to be effective in developing hypothesis for tasks that suffer from impoverished training sets. Difficulties encountered during sequential learning over the diverse domain reinforce the need for a more robust measure of task relatedness."
