ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1841 | Layer 0 | 20250506_225110:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Learning Without State-Estimation in Partially Observable Markovian Decision Processes
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms provide a sound theoretical basis for building learning control architectures for embedded agents. Unfortunately all of the theory and much of the practice (see Barto et al., 1983, for an exception) of RL is limited to Marko-vian decision processes (MDPs). Many real-world decision tasks, however, are inherently non-Markovian, i.e., the state of the environment is only incompletely known to the learning agent. In this paper we consider only partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), a useful class of non-Markovian decision processes. Most previous approaches to such problems have combined computationally expensive state-estimation techniques with learning control. This paper investigates learning in POMDPs without resorting to any form of state estimation. We present results about what TD(0) and Q-learning will do when applied to POMDPs. It is shown that the conventional discounted RL framework is inadequate to deal with POMDPs. Finally we develop a new framework for learning without state-estimation in POMDPs by including stochastic policies in the search space, and by defining the value or utility of a dis tribution over states."
