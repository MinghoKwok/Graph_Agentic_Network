ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1581 | Layer 0 | 20250506_224337:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

Think step-by-step. Consider which label is best supported by both the semantic content of the node text and the examples in memory.
Do not rely on abstract or popular terms alone (like "system" or "accuracy") unless those match the label examples provided.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"A Study of the Generalization Capabilities of XCS
Abstract: We analyze the generalization behavior of the XCS classifier system in environments in which only a few generalizations can be done. Experimental results presented in the paper evidence that the generalization mechanism of XCS can prevent it from learning even simple tasks in such environments. We present a new operator, named Specify, which contributes to the solution of this problem. XCS with the Specify operator, named XCSS, is compared to XCS in terms of performance and generalization capabilities in different types of environments. Experimental results show that XCSS can deal with a greater variety of environments and that it is more robust than XCS with respect to population size."
