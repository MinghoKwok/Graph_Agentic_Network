ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2274 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231350:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Specialization in Populations of Artificial Neural Networks
Abstract: Specialization in populations of artificial neural networks is studied. Organisms with both fixed and evolvable fitness formulae are placed in isolated and shared environments, and the emerged behaviors are compared. An evolvable fitness formula specifies, that the evaluation measure is let free to evolve, and we obtain co-evolution of the expressed behavior and the individual evolvable fitness formula. In an isolated environment a generalist behavior emerges when organisms have a fixed fitness formula, and a specialist behavior emerges when organisms have individual evolvable fitness formulae. A population diversification analysis shows, that almost all organisms in a population in an isolated environment converge towards the same behavioral strategy, while we find, that competition can act to provide population diversification in populations of organisms in a shared environment."
