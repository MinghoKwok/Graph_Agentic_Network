ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 1008 | Layer 0 | 20250506_220727:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Induction of decision trees using RELIEFF
Abstract: In the context of machine learning from examples this paper deals with the problem of estimating the quality of attributes with and without dependencies between them. Greedy search prevents current inductive machine learning algorithms to detect significant dependencies between the attributes. Recently, Kira and Rendell developed the RELIEF algorithm for estimating the quality of attributes that is able to detect dependencies between attributes. We show strong relation between RELIEF's estimates and impurity functions, that are usually used for heuristic guidance of inductive learning algorithms. We propose to use RELIEFF, an extended version of RELIEF, instead of myopic impurity functions. We have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems. Results show the advantage of the presented approach to inductive learning and open a wide rang of possibilities for using RELIEFF."
