ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 601 | Layer 0 | 20250506_212507:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

"Active Gesture Recognition using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 367 Appeared 13th IEEE Intl. Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR '96), Vienna, Austria. Abstract We present a foveated gesture recognition system that guides an active camera to foveate salient features based on a reinforcement learning paradigm. Using vision routines previously implemented for an interactive environment, we determine the spatial location of salient body parts of a user and guide an active camera to obtain images of gestures or expressions. A hidden-state reinforcement learning paradigm based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is used to implement this visual attention. The attention module selects targets to foveate based on the goal of successful recognition, and uses a new multiple-model Q-learning formulation. Given a set of target and distractor gestures, our system can learn where to foveate to maximally discriminate a particular gesture."
