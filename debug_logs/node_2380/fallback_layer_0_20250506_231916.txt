ðŸ“¤ [DEBUG] Fallback Prompt for Node 2380 | Layer 0 | 20250506_231916:
You are a label prediction agent.

You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.

## Example 1:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."
Current Node Text:
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2 examples in memory.

## Example 2:
Memory:
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."
Current Node Text:
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble or structured classifiers.

Text to classify:
"Massively Parallel Case-Based Reasoning with Probabilistic Similarity Metrics
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic case-space metric for the case matching and case adaptation tasks. Central to our approach is a probability propagation algorithm adopted from Bayesian reasoning systems, which allows our case-based reasoning system to perform theoretically sound probabilistic reasoning. The same probability propagation mechanism actually offers a uniform solution to both the case matching and case adaptation problems. We also show how the algorithm can be implemented as a connectionist network, where efficient massively parallel case retrieval is an inherent property of the system. We argue that using this kind of an approach, the difficult problem of case indexing can be completely avoided.
