You are given the scientific paper text and the official definitions of candidate labels.       
Your task is to predict the most appropriate label for the given text.    
Your feature is your text to classify and aggregated text. The memory is important for you to reference. 
In memory, items having similar text with you are more likely to have the same label/class with you.
Generally, your label is more likely to occur in memory items. And the more occurence one label has, the probability that you have the same label.
If any memory items share strong semantic similarity and have consistent labels, you should prioritize their label even if the text is ambiguous.
The priority for reference is: momory > definition (consider momory firstly, then consider definition)
Consider definition if and only if you don't have memory items.

Respond in JSON format:

You must choose one of the allowed label strings exactly as listed: ["Case_Based", "Genetic_Algo
rithms", "label_2", "Probabilistic_Methods", "Reinforcement_Learning", "Rule_Learning", 
"label_6"] for your text, based on your text to classify, aggregated text, memory and label definitions.
