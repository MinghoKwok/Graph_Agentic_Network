You are a Rule-Based Label Prediction Agent
You will be given a text to classify and a list of memory items (label-text pairs). Your job is to assign the correct label to the text based on strict classification rules, not freeform semantic intuition.

Text to classify:
"Multiagent Systems Engineering: A Methodology And Language for Designing Agent Systems
This paper overviews MaSE and provides a high-level introduction to one critical component used within MaSE, the Agent Modeling Language. Details on the Agent Definition Language and detailed agent design are left for a future paper."

Memory items (label-text pairs):
[Label_2] On Securely Scheduling A Meeting: proposes secure scheduling protocols using mobile agents.
[Label_2] Parameter Learning of Logic Programs: EM algorithm for logic programs with probabilistic facts.
[Label_2] Scalable and Secure Global Tracking Service: tracking mobile agents with impersonation protections.
[Label_2] TRIPS: Integrated AI system for dialogue and planning agents.
[Label_1] Analysis and Design using MaSE: engineering multiagent systems using agentTool environment.
[Label_3] Overview of Multiagent Systems Engineering Methodology: coordinating behavior of agents in complex software systems.
[Label_4] Automated Derivation of Agent Architectures: automatic code generation in MaSE framework.
[Label_1] Automated Derivation of Architectures from Specifications: formal transformation in MaSE for agent synthesis.
[Label_2] Standardization of Multi-Agent Systems Architectures: definitions and standard efforts in multi-agent research.
[Label_2] Tracking Service for Mobile Agents: privacy-preserving agent tracking system over Internet.

Allowed labels: ["Label_0", "Label_1", "Label_2", "Label_3", "Label_4", "Label_5"]

========================
‚úÖ Classification Rules (Follow Strictly):
üîµ Rule 1: Majority Label Rule
If one label appears more times than any other, you must assign that label.
Even if another label looks slightly more semantically similar, DO NOT override.

Example:
Label_2 appears 5 times
‚Üí You must return Label_2

üü° Rule 2: Override Exception (Rare)
You may override the majority ONLY IF ALL the following conditions are met:

The current text is clearly incompatible with the majority label group;

There is another label with at least 2 memory items;

You provide this exact 3-part justification:

State the majority label;

Explain why the current text does not match it;

Explain why the new label has better support from memory.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you override without this format, your prediction is INVALID.

üî¥ Rule 3: No Overfitting / No Guessing
Do NOT rely on vague words like ‚Äúagent‚Äù, ‚Äúsystem‚Äù, ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù.

Match based on task, method, and topic.

When unsure: prefer the majority label, or the lower-numbered label among ties.

üßæ Final Output Format (JSON only):

{
  "action_type": "update",
  "predicted_label": "Label_X",
  "justification": "..." 
}
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT IGNORE THIS
You are NOT doing freeform semantic matching.
You are executing a rule-based classification protocol.
Disregarding the majority label without structured override is a critical failure.

‚úÖ When the current text has some relevance to both groups, always prefer the majority label ‚Äî even if it feels less ‚Äúsemantically elegant‚Äù.
