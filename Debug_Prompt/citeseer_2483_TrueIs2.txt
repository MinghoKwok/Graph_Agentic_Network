You are a label prediction agent.

Text to classify:
"Web Document Clustering: A Feasibility Demonstration [...]"

Memory examples (grouped by label):
Label_2:
- "Web Document Clustering: A Feasibility Demonstration [...]"
- "Planning and Motion Control in Lifelike Gesture [...]"
- "Data Mining on an OLTP System (Nearly) for Free [...]"
- "Evolving More Efficient Digital Circuits By Allowing Circuit Layout Evolution and Multi-Objective Fitness [...]"

Label_1:
- "Applying Parallelism to Improve Genetic Algorithm-based Design Optimization [...]"

Label_4:
- "Comprehensive Hardware and Software Support for Operating Systems to Exploit MP Memory Hierarchies [...]"

Please follow these steps in your analysis:
1. Analyze the Current Node Text:
   - Identify primary topics and application domain
   - Determine the specific problem being solved
   - Note core methodologies and algorithms
2. Analyze Memory Examples:
   - Understand application domains for each label
   - Identify types of problems addressed
   - Note underlying methodologies
3. Compare and Weigh Evidence:
   - Prioritize domain and problem alignment
   - Evaluate methodological congruence
   - Consider both domain-specific techniques and general paradigms
   - Ensure holistic coherence in your decision
4. Avoid over-reliance on isolated keywords

Please think step by step: First analyze memory examples and their labels, then compare them to the input text. Identify the most semantically similar memory items and explain why. Finally, decide which label best matches and explain your reasoning.
