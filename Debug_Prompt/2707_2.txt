ðŸ“¦ [Fallback Prompt for Node 2707]:                                                          
You are a label prediction agent.                                                            
                                                                                             
You will be given a set of labeled memory items and a new node to classify.                  
Each example includes a few labeled texts as memory and a new text to classify.              
Use the memory to predict the label for the current text.                                    
                                                                                             
## Example 1:                                                                                
Memory:                                                                                      
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for sequence modeling and pattern discovery."             
2. [Label_1] "Neural networks for text classification."                                      
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian models for probabilistic inference."                                  
Current Node Text:                                                                           
"Markov models for speech sequence alignment."                                               
Prediction: Label_2                                                                          
Reasoning: The text discusses Markov models and speech alignment, which closely match Label_2
 examples in memory.   

## Example 2:          
Memory:                
1. [Label_2] "Hidden Markov models for biological sequence alignment."                       
2. [Label_6] "Improving ensemble model selection with probabilistic voting."
3. [Label_2] "Bayesian inference for protein sequence homology detection."
4. [Label_6] "Boosted decision trees for structured data classification."
5. [Label_3] "Non-reversible Markov chains for MCMC sampling."                               
Current Node Text:     
"Homology detection in genetic sequences using Bayesian Markov modeling."
Prediction: Label_2    
Reasoning: Although both Label_2 and Label_6 are well represented in memory, the current node
 text focuses on homology detection and Bayesian modeling, which strongly aligns with Label_2
 examples related to biological sequences and probabilistic inference, rather than ensemble o
r structured classifiers.
