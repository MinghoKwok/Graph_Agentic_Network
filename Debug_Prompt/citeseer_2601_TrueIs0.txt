"A Comparison of Mobile Agent and Client-Server Paradigms for Information Retrieval Tasks in Virtual Enterprises In next-generation enterprises it will become increasingly important to retrieve information efficiently and rapidly from widely dispersed sites in a virtual enterprise, and the number of users who wish to do using wireless and portable devices will increase significantly. This paper considers the use of mobile agent technology rather than traditional clientserver computing for information retrieval by mobile and wireless users in a virtual enterprise. We argue that to be successful mobile agent platforms must coexist with, and be presented to the applications programmer sideby -side with, traditional client-server middleware like CORBA and DCOM, and we sketch a middleware architecture for doing so. We then develop an analytical model that examines the claimed performance benefits of mobile agents over client-server computing for a mobile information retrieval scenario. Our evaluation of the model shows that mobile agents are not always better than client-server calls in terms of average response times; they are only beneficial if the space overhead of the mobile agent code is not too large or if the wireless link connecting the mobile user to the fixed servers of the virtual enterprise is error-prone."

Please follow these steps in your analysis:
1. Analyze the Current Node Text:
   - Identify primary topics and application domain
   - Determine the specific problem being solved
   - Note core methodologies and algorithms
2. Analyze Memory Examples:
   - Understand application domains for each label
   - Identify types of problems addressed
   - Note underlying methodologies
3. Compare and Weigh Evidence:
   - Prioritize domain and problem alignment
   - Evaluate methodological congruence
   - Consider both domain-specific techniques and general paradigms
   - Ensure holistic coherence in your decision
4. Avoid over-reliance on isolated keywords

Label_0 examples focus on database management, schema changes, and data consistency
Avoid confusing with mobile agents or user-driven interaction (common in Label_2 and Label_4)

Please think step by step: First analyze memory examples and their labels, then compare them to the input text. Identify the most semantically similar memory items and explain why. Finally, decide which label best matches and explain your reasoning.
